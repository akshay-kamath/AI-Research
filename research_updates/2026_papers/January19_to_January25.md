| [Empowering Medical Equipment Sustainability in Low-Resource Settings: An AI-Powered Diagnostic and Support Platform for Biomedical Technicians](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16967v1) | Bernes Lorier Atabonfack, Ahmed Tahiru Issah, Mohammed Hardi Abdul Baaki, Clemence Ingabire, Tolulope Olusuyi, Maruf Adewole, Udunna C. Anazodo, Timothy X Brown | 2026-01-23 | LLM | In low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), a significant proportion of medical diagnostic equipment remains underutilized or non-functional due to a lack of timely maintenance, limited access to technical expertise, and minimal support from manufacturers, particularly for devices acquired through third-party vendors or donations. This challenge contributes to increased equipment downtime, delayed diagnoses, and compromised patient care. This research explores the development and validation of an AI-powered support platform designed to assist biomedical technicians in diagnosing and repairing medical devices in real-time. The system integrates a large language model (LLM) with a user-friendly web interface, enabling imaging technologists/radiographers and biomedical technicians to input error codes or device symptoms and receive accurate, step-by-step troubleshooting guidance. The platform also includes a global peer-to-peer discussion forum to support knowledge exchange and provide additional context for rare or undocumented issues. A proof of concept was developed using the Philips HDI 5000 ultrasound machine, achieving 100% precision in error code interpretation and 80% accuracy in suggesting corrective actions. This study demonstrates the feasibility and potential of AI-driven systems to support medical device maintenance, with the aim of reducing equipment downtime to improve healthcare delivery in resource-constrained environments. | [🔗 Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16967v1) |

| [Latent Diffusion for Internet of Things Attack Data Generation in Intrusion Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16976v1) | Estela Sánchez-Carballo, Francisco M. Melgarejo-Meseguer, José Luis Rojo-Álvarez | 2026-01-23 | Diffusion Models | Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) are a key component for protecting Internet of Things (IoT) environments. However, in Machine Learning-based (ML-based) IDSs, performance is often degraded by the strong class imbalance between benign and attack traffic. Although data augmentation has been widely explored to mitigate this issue, existing approaches typically rely on simple oversampling techniques or generative models that struggle to simultaneously achieve high sample fidelity, diversity, and computational efficiency. To address these limitations, we propose the use of a Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) for attack data augmentation in IoT intrusion detection and provide a comprehensive comparison against state-of-the-art baselines. Experiments were conducted on three representative IoT attack types, specifically Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS), Mirai, and Man-in-the-Middle, evaluating both downstream IDS performance and intrinsic generative quality using distributional, dependency-based, and diversity metrics. Results show that balancing the training data with LDM-generated samples substantially improves IDS performance, achieving F1-scores of up to 0.99 for DDoS and Mirai attacks and consistently outperforming competing methods. Additionally, quantitative and qualitative analyses demonstrate that LDMs effectively preserve feature dependencies while generating diverse samples and reduce sampling time by approximately 25\% compared to diffusion models operating directly in data space. These findings highlight latent diffusion as an effective and scalable solution for synthetic IoT attack data generation, substantially mitigating the impact of class imbalance in ML-based IDSs for IoT scenarios. | [🔗 Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16976v1) |
| [Auto-Regressive Masked Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16971v1) | Mahdi Karami, Ali Ghodsi | 2026-01-23 | Diffusion Models | Masked diffusion models (MDMs) have emerged as a promising approach for language modeling, yet they face a performance gap compared to autoregressive models (ARMs) and require more training iterations. In this work, we present the Auto-Regressive Masked Diffusion (ARMD) model, an architecture designed to close this gap by unifying the training efficiency of autoregressive models with the parallel generation capabilities of diffusion-based models. Our key insight is to reframe the masked diffusion process as a block-wise causal model. This perspective allows us to design a strictly causal, permutation-equivariant architecture that computes all conditional probabilities across multiple denoising steps in a single, parallel forward pass. The resulting architecture supports efficient, autoregressive-style decoding and a progressive permutation training scheme, allowing the model to learn both canonical left-to-right and random token orderings. Leveraging this flexibility, we introduce a novel strided parallel generation strategy that accelerates inference by generating tokens in parallel streams while maintaining global coherence. Empirical results demonstrate that ARMD achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard language modeling benchmarks, outperforming established diffusion baselines while requiring significantly fewer training steps. Furthermore, it establishes a new benchmark for parallel text generation, effectively bridging the performance gap between parallel and sequential decoding. | [🔗 Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16971v1) |
| [Thermodynamically consistent large-eddy simulation models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16957v1) | Thomas Dubos | 2026-01-23 | Diffusion Models | Filtered budgets for anelastic turbulence and a general expression of the turbulent sensible heat flux are derived for a multicomponent fluid with an arbitrary equation of state. A family of subgrid-scale closures is then found under the constraint of consistency with (i) the first and second laws of thermodynamics and (ii) invariance with respect to irrelevant thermodynamic constants. A similar family of fully compressible models is also constructed heuristically. These models predict turbulent kinetic energy, assume down-gradient closures for three-dimensional turbulent fluxes and impose certain relationships between the closures for the turbulent fluxes of heat, matter, entropy, and the work of buoyancy forces.   A key finding is the explicit derivation of the local rate of entropy production in the filtered model. Positive entropy production is guaranteed whenever the turbulent diffusions of heat and composition are positive and no cross-diffusion occurs. Cross-diffusivities are admissible provided their magnitude is within the bounds of an explicit criterion. The filtered model is invariant under a wider class of transformations than the unfiltered model. Furthermore, in the special case of a single turbulent diffusivity, an arbitrary conservative variable can be prognosed while ignoring its precise relationship to entropy.   These findings show that down-gradient closures are consistent with the first and second law of thermodynamics even when they lead to a turbulent sensible heat flux up the temperature gradient. Indeed, while molecular conduction/diffusion is spontaneous and energy-conserving, stratified turbulent mixing is driven by mechanical turbulence and enabled by the consumption of turbulent kinetic energy. | [🔗 Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16957v1) |

| [Autonomous Optical Alignment of Satellite-Based Entanglement Sources using Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16968v1) | Andrzej Gajewski, Robert Okuła, Marcin Pawłowski, Akshata Shenoy H | 2026-01-23 | RLHF | Quantum entanglement distributed via satellites enable global-scale quantum communication. However, onboard sources are susceptible to misalignment due to dynamical orbital conditions. Here, we present two recalibration techniques for efficient generation of high quality entanglement using a periodically poled lithium niobate (PPLN)-based spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) source with minimum intervention. The first is a heuristic algorithm (HA) which mimics the manual alignment process in a laboratory. The second is based on reinforcement learning (RL). Our simulation demonstrates superior performance of RL with AUC=0.9119 compared to HA's 0.7042 in the modified ROC analysis (60 min threshold). RL achieves perfect alignment in 10 min as opposed to HA's 30 min. Both the methods operate within feasible satellite constraints, offering scalable automation for complex quantum communication scenarios. | [🔗 Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16968v1) |
| [Forecast on the generalised dark matter properties from a Euclid-like survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16943v1) | Ziad Sakr, Jessica N. López-Sánchez | 2026-01-23 | RLHF | The Stage~IV \textit{Euclid} mission will deliver spectroscopic galaxy redshifts together with photometric positions and shapes, enabling cosmological analyses through spectroscopic galaxy clustering (GCsp), photometric galaxy clustering (GCph), weak-lensing cosmic shear (WL), and their cross-correlation (XC). In this work we forecast the constraining power of a Euclid-like survey on the Generalised Dark Matter (GDM) parameters \(w_{\rm gdm}\) and \(c^{2}_{s,{\rm gdm}}\). Our analysis extends previous forecasting pipeline used for standard cold dark matter. For GCsp, we adopt a semi-analytic nonlinear RSD model, with free terms for each bin. For the photometric probes, we compute the nonlinear GDM matter power spectrum using dedicated simulations, and we modify the lensing and clustering window and the intrinsic-alignment prescription. We consider several survey configurations and explore three fiducial values of \(σ_8\) motivated by current CMB and low-redshift measurements. In an optimistic setting, for fiducial values \(σ_8 \simeq 0.81\) and \(σ_8 \simeq 0.77\), we find relative errors of \(4.01\%\) (GCsp), \(5.01\%\) (GCph+WL+XC), and \(1.96\%\) (all probes) on \(c^{2}_{s,{\rm gdm}}\), and \(3.26\%\) (GCph+WL+XC) and \(1.85\%\) (all probes) on \(w_{\rm gdm}\). For a lower fiducial value \(σ_8 \simeq 0.67\), that could strongly disfavor $Λ$GDM, we find constraints of \(5\%\) (GCsp), \(5\%\) (GCph+WL+XC), and \(2.45\%\) (all probes) on \(c^{2}_{s,{\rm gdm}}\), and \(3.43\%\) (GCph+WL+XC) and \(2.04\%\) (all probes) on \(w_{\rm gdm}\). We also found that, combining all probes, whether in the pessimistic or optimistic settings, a Euclid-like survey will be able to disentangle between the three scenarios. These results show that the survey will be able to constrain the GDM parameters and distinguish between normalisations of the matter fluctuations.(Abridged) | [🔗 Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16943v1) |

Chan, Sewon Min, Joseph E. Gonzalez | 2026-01-23 | Multimodal AI, Memory & Context Length | Modern Vision-Language Models (VLMs) remain poorly characterized in multi-step visual interactions, particularly in how they integrate perception, memory, and action over long horizons. We introduce VisGym, a gymnasium of 17 environments for evaluating and training VLMs. The suite spans symbolic puzzles, real-image understanding, navigation, and manipulation, and provides flexible controls over difficulty, input representation, planning horizon, and feedback. We also provide multi-step solvers that generate structured demonstrations, enabling supervised finetuning. Our evaluations show that all frontier models struggle in interactive settings, achieving low success rates in both the easy (46.6%) and hard (26.0%) configurations. Our experiments reveal notable limitations: models struggle to effectively leverage long context, performing worse with an unbounded history than with truncated windows. Furthermore, we find that several text-based symbolic tasks become substantially harder once rendered visually. However, explicit goal observations, textual feedback, and exploratory demonstrations in partially observable or unknown-dynamics settings for supervised finetuning yield consistent gains, highlighting concrete failure modes and pathways for improving multi-step visual decision-making.

| [A Scalable Measure of Loss Landscape Curvature for Analyzing the Training Dynamics of LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16979v1) | Dayal Singh Kalra, Jean-Christophe Gagnon-Audet, Andrey Gromov, Ishita Mediratta, Kelvin Niu, Alexander H Miller, Michael Shvartsman | 2026-01-23 | Optimization, Scaling Laws | Understanding the curvature evolution of the loss landscape is fundamental to analyzing the training dynamics of neural networks. The most commonly studied measure, Hessian sharpness ($λ_{\max}^H$) -- the largest eigenvalue of the loss Hessian -- determines local training stability and interacts with the learning rate throughout training. Despite its significance in analyzing training dynamics, direct measurement of Hessian sharpness remains prohibitive for Large Language Models (LLMs) due to high computational cost. We analyze $\textit{critical sharpness}$ ($λ_c$), a computationally efficient measure requiring fewer than $10$ forward passes given the update direction $Δ\mathbfθ$. Critically, this measure captures well-documented Hessian sharpness phenomena, including progressive sharpening and Edge of Stability. Using this measure, we provide the first demonstration of these sharpness phenomena at scale, up to $7$B parameters, spanning both pre-training and mid-training of OLMo-2 models. We further introduce $\textit{relative critical sharpness}$ ($λ_c^{1\to 2}$), which quantifies the curvature of one loss landscape while optimizing another, to analyze the transition from pre-training to fine-tuning and guide data mixing strategies. Critical sharpness provides practitioners with a practical tool for diagnosing curvature dynamics and informing data composition choices at scale. More broadly, our work shows that scalable curvature measures can provide actionable insights for large-scale training. | [🔗 Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16979v1) |
| [BONO-Bench: A Comprehensive Test Suite for Bi-objective Numerical Optimization with Traceable Pareto Sets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16970v1) | Lennart Schäpermeier, Pascal Kerschke | 2026-01-23 | Optimization, Model Evaluation, Training & Evaluation, Multimodal AI | The evaluation of heuristic optimizers on test problems, better known as \emph{benchmarking}, is a cornerstone of research in multi-objective optimization.   However, most test problems used in benchmarking numerical multi-objective black-box optimizers come from one of two flawed approaches: On the one hand, problems are constructed manually, which result in problems with well-understood optimal solutions, but unrealistic properties and biases.   On the other hand, more realistic and complex single-objective problems are composited into multi-objective problems, but with a lack of control and understanding of problem properties.   This paper proposes an extensive problem generation approach for bi-objective numerical optimization problems consisting of the combination of theoretically well-understood convex-quadratic functions into unimodal and multimodal landscapes with and without global structure.   It supports configuration of test problem properties, such as the number of decision variables, local optima, Pareto front shape, plateaus in the objective space, or degree of conditioning, while maintaining theoretical tractability: The optimal front can be approximated to an arbitrary degree of precision regarding Pareto-compliant performance indicators such as the hypervolume or the exact R2 indicator.   To demonstrate the generator's capabilities, a test suite of 20 problem categories, called \emph{BONO-Bench}, is created and subsequently used as a basis of an illustrative benchmark study.   Finally, the general approach underlying our proposed generator, together with the associated test suite, is publicly released in the Python package \texttt{bonobench} to facilitate reproducible benchmarking. | [🔗 Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16970v1) |
| [AgentDrive: An Open Benchmark Dataset for Agentic AI Reasoning with LLM-Generated Scenarios in Autonomous Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16964v1) | Mohamed Amine Ferrag, Abderrahmane Lakas, Merouane Debbah | 2026-01-23 | Optimization, Autonomous Agents, Training & Evaluation | The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has sparked growing interest in their integration into autonomous systems for reasoning-driven perception, planning, and decision-making. However, evaluating and training such agentic AI models remains challenging due to the lack of large-scale, structured, and safety-critical benchmarks. This paper introduces AgentDrive, an open benchmark dataset containing 300,000 LLM-generated driving scenarios designed for training, fine-tuning, and evaluating autonomous agents under diverse conditions. AgentDrive formalizes a factorized scenario space across seven orthogonal axes: scenario type, driver behavior, environment, road layout, objective, difficulty, and traffic density. An LLM-driven prompt-to-JSON pipeline generates semantically rich, simulation-ready specifications that are validated against physical and schema constraints. Each scenario undergoes simulation rollouts, surrogate safety metric computation, and rule-based outcome labeling. To complement simulation-based evaluation, we introduce AgentDrive-MCQ, a 100,000-question multiple-choice benchmark spanning five reasoning dimensions: physics, policy, hybrid, scenario, and comparative reasoning. We conduct a large-scale evaluation of fifty leading LLMs on AgentDrive-MCQ. Results show that while proprietary frontier models perform best in contextual and policy reasoning, advanced open models are rapidly closing the gap in structured and physics-grounded reasoning. We release the AgentDrive dataset, AgentDrive-MCQ benchmark, evaluation code, and related materials at https://github.com/maferrag/AgentDrive | [🔗 Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16964v1) |
| [Constrained Symplectic Quantization I: the Quantum Harmonic Oscillator](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16963v1) | Martina Giachello, Francesco Scardino, Giacomo Gradenigo | 2026-01-23 | Optimization | Symplectic quantization is a functional approach to quantum field theory that allows sampling of quantum fluctuations directly in Minkowski space-time by means of a generalized microcanonical ensemble similar to the one of the standard microcanonical approach to lattice field theory. In a previous paper we showed that, for an interacting scalar field theory in 1+1-dimensions, this formalism allows to capture numerically some crucial real-time features inaccessible to any Euclidean approach to lattice field theory. Yet, the new approach was plagued by two main limitations: an ill-defined non-interacting limit and the absence of a direct formal correspondence between its correlation functions and those generated by the Feynman path integral approach. In this paper, we introduce the new \emph{"constrained symplectic quantization"} approach, for which the perfect equivalence with the Feynman path integral is proved and which is perfectly well defined for the free theory. This new approach is characterized by the analytical continuation of all fields and of the action from $\mathbb{R}$ to $\mathbb{C}$ and the presence of some constraints which guarantee the stability of the generalized Hamiltonian dynamics and the convergence of the corresponding generalized microcanonical partition function, hence the name of the theory. We show the application of this formalism to the quantum harmonic oscillator on a Minkowskian-time lattice, finding perfect agreement between one- and two-point numerical correlators and the exact quantum-mechanical results. We observe genuine real-time features such as the oscillatory propagator and the discrete excited-state energy spectrum. Our results provide strong numerical evidence that constrained symplectic quantization can sample real-time quantum-mechanical observables, offering a concrete route to overcome the limitations of Euclidean-time importance sampling. | [🔗 Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16963v1) |
| [Reward-Forcing: Autoregressive Video Generation with Reward Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16933v1) | Jingran Zhang, Ning Li, Yuanhao Ban, Andrew Bai, Justin Cui | 2026-01-23 | Optimization, Multimodal AI | While most prior work in video generation relies on bidirectional architectures, recent efforts have sought to adapt these models into autoregressive variants to support near real-time generation. However, such adaptations often depend heavily on teacher models, which can limit performance, particularly in the absence of a strong autoregressive teacher, resulting in output quality that typically lags behind their bidirectional counterparts. In this paper, we explore an alternative approach that uses reward signals to guide the generation process, enabling more efficient and scalable autoregressive generation. By using reward signals to guide the model, our method simplifies training while preserving high visual fidelity and temporal consistency. Through extensive experiments on standard benchmarks, we find that our approach performs comparably to existing autoregressive models and, in some cases, surpasses similarly sized bidirectional models by avoiding constraints imposed by teacher architectures. For example, on VBench, our method achieves a total score of 84.92, closely matching state-of-the-art autoregressive methods that score 84.31 but require significant heterogeneous distillation. | [🔗 Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16933v1) |

| [Anisotropy Strikes Back: Modified Gravity and Dark Matter Halos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16958v1) | Paolo M Bassani | 2026-01-23 | Scaling Laws | We explore dark matter like fluids in a spherically symmetric Lemaitre Tolman Bondi (LTB) minisuperspace, tracking how symmetry properties of the Hamiltonian constraint control the emergence of effective dark sources in General Relativity (GR) and Horava Lifshitz (HL) gravity. We first deform the GR Hamiltonian by adding an extra weight $+1$ density to the potential. We show that potential deformations of this type leave the (reduced) Dirac algebra unchanged and the modification is naturally reinterpreted as an effective anisotropic stress energy contribution. While the fluid reproduces an isothermal-like mass scaling, its pressure anisotropy prevents it from giving flat rotation curves. We then turn to HL gravity, where the deformed Dirac algebra induces a controlled nonconservation law for an emergent dust component. Generalizing earlier results, we identify a restricted class of LTB backgrounds for which the HL source term yields a positive scaling dark matter density, consistent with ghost-freedom, and recovery of GR in the infrared. The analysis is conditional on a prescribed background: obtaining a fully backreacted areal radius solution consistent with the HL field equations is left as a natural direction for future work. | [🔗 Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16958v1) |
| [DataStates-LLM: Scalable Checkpointing for Transformer Models Using Composable State Providers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16956v1) | Avinash Maurya, M. Mustafa Rafique, Franck Cappello, Bogdan Nicolae | 2026-01-23 | Scaling Laws, LLM | The rapid growth of Large Transformer-based models, specifically Large Language Models (LLMs), now scaling to trillions of parameters, has necessitated training across thousands of GPUs using complex hybrid parallelism strategies (e.g., data, tensor, and pipeline parallelism). Checkpointing this massive, distributed state is critical for a wide range of use cases, such as resilience, suspend-resume, investigating undesirable training trajectories, and explaining model evolution. However, existing checkpointing solutions typically treat model state as opaque binary blobs, ignoring the ``3D heterogeneity'' of the underlying data structures--varying by memory location (GPU vs. Host), number of ``logical'' objects sharded and split across multiple files, data types (tensors vs. Python objects), and their serialization requirements. This results in significant runtime overheads due to blocking device-to-host transfers, data-oblivious serialization, and storage I/O contention. In this paper, we introduce DataStates-LLM, a novel checkpointing architecture that leverages State Providers to decouple state abstraction from data movement. DataStates-LLM exploits the immutability of model parameters during the forward and backward passes to perform ``lazy'', non-blocking asynchronous snapshots. By introducing State Providers, we efficiently coalesce fragmented, heterogeneous shards and overlap the serialization of metadata with bulk tensor I/O. We evaluate DataStates-LLM on models up to 70B parameters on 256 A100-40GB GPUs. Our results demonstrate that DataStates-LLM achieves up to 4$\times$ higher checkpointing throughput and reduces end-to-end training time by up to 2.2$\times$ compared to state-of-the-art solutions, effectively mitigating the serialization and heterogeneity bottlenecks in extreme-scale LLM training. | [🔗 Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16956v1) |

| [A new class of colored Gaussian graphical models with explicit normalizing constants](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16945v1) | Adam Chojecki, Piotr Graczyk, Hideyuki Ishi, Bartosz Kołodziejek | 2026-01-23 | Training & Evaluation | We study Bayesian model selection in colored Gaussian graphical models (CGGMs), which combine sparsity of conditional independencies with symmetry constraints encoded by vertex- and edge-colored graphs. A computational bottleneck in Bayesian inference for CGGMs is the evaluation of Diaconis-Ylvisaker normalizing constants, given by gamma-type integrals over cones of precision matrices with prescribed zeros and equality constraints. While explicit formulas are known for standard Gaussian graphical models only in special cases (e.g. decomposable graphs) and for a limited class of RCOP models, no general tractable framework has been available for broader families of CGGMs.   We introduce a new subclass of RCON models for which these normalizing constants admit closed-form expressions. On the algebraic side, we identify conditions on spaces of colored precision matrices that guarantee tractability of the associated integrals, leading to Block-Cholesky spaces (BC-spaces) and Diagonally Commutative Block-Cholesky spaces (DCBC-spaces). On the combinatorial side, we characterize the colored graphs inducing such spaces via a color perfect elimination ordering and a 2-path regularity condition, and define the resulting Color Elimination-Regular (CER) graphs and their symmetric variants. This class strictly extends decomposable graphs in the uncolored setting and contains all RCOP models associated with decomposable graphs. In the one-color case, our framework reveals a close connection between DCBC-spaces and Bose-Mesner algebras.   For models defined on BC- and DCBC-spaces, we derive explicit closed-form formulas for the normalizing constants in terms of a finite collection of structure constants and propose an efficient method for computing them in the commutative case. Our results broaden the range of CGGMs amenable to principled Bayesian structure learning in high-dimensional applications. | [🔗 Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16945v1) |

To quantify any potential reflection biases, we introduce a permutation-based evaluation framework. With this, we observe that state-of-the-art embedding models exhibit systematic positional and language biases when documents are longer and consist of multiple segments. Specifically, early segments and segments in higher-resource languages like English are over-represented, while later segments and segments in lower-resource languages are marginalized. In our further analysis, we find that the positional bias stems from front-loaded attention distributions in pooling-token embeddings, where early tokens receive more attention. To mitigate this issue, we introduce an inference-time attention calibration method that redistributes attention more evenly across document positions, increasing discoverabiltiy of later segments. Our evaluation framework and attention calibration is available at https://github.com/impresso/fair-sentence-transformers | [🔗 Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16934v1) |

Huynh, Ulas Bagci, Min Xu | 2026-01-23 | Model Evaluation, RLHF, Responsible AI | Deep learning has shown remarkable progress in medical image semantic segmentation, yet its success heavily depends on large-scale expert annotations and consistent data distributions. In practice, annotations are scarce, and images are collected from multiple scanners or centers, leading to mixed-domain settings with unknown domain labels and severe domain gaps. Existing semi-supervised or domain adaptation approaches typically assume either a single domain shift or access to explicit domain indices, which rarely hold in real-world deployment. In this paper, we propose a domain-invariant mixed-domain semi-supervised segmentation framework that jointly enhances data diversity and mitigates domain bias. A Copy-Paste Mechanism (CPM) augments the training set by transferring informative regions across domains, while a Cluster Maximum Mean Discrepancy (CMMD) block clusters unlabeled features and aligns them with labeled anchors via an MMD objective, encouraging domain-invariant representations. Integrated within a teacher-student framework, our method achieves robust and precise segmentation even with very few labeled examples and multiple unknown domain discrepancies. Experiments on Fundus and M&Ms benchmarks demonstrate that our approach consistently surpasses semi-supervised and domain adaptation methods, establishing a potential solution for mixed-domain semi-supervised medical image segmentation. | [🔗 Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16954v1) |

| [Evaluating Wi-Fi Performance for VR Streaming: A Study on Realistic HEVC Video Traffic](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16950v1) | Ferran Maura, Francesc Wilhelmi, Boris Bellalta | 2026-01-23 | Production and Deployment, Multimodal AI | Cloud-based Virtual Reality (VR) streaming presents significant challenges for 802.11 networks due to its high throughput and low latency requirements. When multiple VR users share a Wi-Fi network, the resulting uplink and downlink traffic can quickly saturate the channel. This paper investigates the capacity of 802.11 networks for supporting realistic VR streaming workloads across varying frame rates, bitrates, codec settings, and numbers of users. We develop an emulation framework that reproduces Air Light VR (ALVR) operation, where real HEVC video traffic is fed into an 802.11 simulation model. Our findings explore Wi-Fi's performance anomaly and demonstrate that Intra-refresh (IR) coding effectively reduces latency variability and improves QoS, supporting up to 4 concurrent VR users with Constant Bitrate (CBR) 100 Mbps before the channel is saturated. | [🔗 Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16950v1) |
| [Is BatchEnsemble a Single Model? On Calibration and Diversity of Efficient Ensembles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16936v1) | Anton Zamyatin, Patrick Indri, Sagar Malhotra, Thomas Gärtner | 2026-01-23 | Production and Deployment, Ongoing Learning | In resource-constrained and low-latency settings, uncertainty estimates must be efficiently obtained. Deep Ensembles provide robust epistemic uncertainty (EU) but require training multiple full-size models. BatchEnsemble aims to deliver ensemble-like EU at far lower parameter and memory cost by applying learned rank-1 perturbations to a shared base network. We show that BatchEnsemble not only underperforms Deep Ensembles but closely tracks a single model baseline in terms of accuracy, calibration and out-of-distribution (OOD) detection on CIFAR10/10C/SVHN. A controlled study on MNIST finds members are near-identical in function and parameter space, indicating limited capacity to realize distinct predictive modes. Thus, BatchEnsemble behaves more like a single model than a true ensemble. | [🔗 Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16936v1) |

| [AnyView: Synthesizing Any Novel View in Dynamic Scenes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16982v1) | Basile Van Hoorick, Dian Chen, Shun Iwase, Pavel Tokmakov, Muhammad Zubair Irshad, Igor Vasiljevic, Swati Gupta, Fangzhou Cheng, Sergey Zakharov, Vitor Campagnolo Guizilini | 2026-01-23 | Prompt Engineering, Diffusion Models, Multimodal AI | Modern generative video models excel at producing convincing, high-quality outputs, but struggle to maintain multi-view and spatiotemporal consistency in highly dynamic real-world environments. In this work, we introduce \textbf{AnyView}, a diffusion-based video generation framework for \emph{dynamic view synthesis} with minimal inductive biases or geometric assumptions. We leverage multiple data sources with various levels of supervision, including monocular (2D), multi-view static (3D) and multi-view dynamic (4D) datasets, to train a generalist spatiotemporal implicit representation capable of producing zero-shot novel videos from arbitrary camera locations and trajectories. We evaluate AnyView on standard benchmarks, showing competitive results with the current state of the art, and propose \textbf{AnyViewBench}, a challenging new benchmark tailored towards \emph{extreme} dynamic view synthesis in diverse real-world scenarios. In this more dramatic setting, we find that most baselines drastically degrade in performance, as they require significant overlap between viewpoints, while AnyView maintains the ability to produce realistic, plausible, and spatiotemporally consistent videos when prompted from \emph{any} viewpoint.

| [SyncLight: Controllable and Consistent Multi-View Relighting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16981v1) | David Serrano-Lozano, Anand Bhattad, Luis Herranz, Jean-François Lalonde, Javier Vazquez-Corral | 2026-01-23 | Prompt Engineering, LLM, Diffusion Models | We present SyncLight, the first method to enable consistent, parametric relighting across multiple uncalibrated views of a static scene. While single-view relighting has advanced significantly, existing generative approaches struggle to maintain the rigorous lighting consistency essential for multi-camera broadcasts, stereoscopic cinema, and virtual production. SyncLight addresses this by enabling precise control over light intensity and color across a multi-view capture of a scene, conditioned on a single reference edit. Our method leverages a multi-view diffusion transformer trained using a latent bridge matching formulation, achieving high-fidelity relighting of the entire image set in a single inference step. To facilitate training, we introduce a large-scale hybrid dataset comprising diverse synthetic environments -- curated from existing sources and newly designed scenes -- alongside high-fidelity, real-world multi-view captures under calibrated illumination. Surprisingly, though trained only on image pairs, SyncLight generalizes zero-shot to an arbitrary number of viewpoints, effectively propagating lighting changes across all views, without requiring camera pose information. SyncLight enables practical relighting workflows for multi-view capture systems. | [🔗 Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16981v1) |

| [Calibrating redshift distributions at $z>2$ with Lyman-$α$ forest cross-correlations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16962v1) | Qianjun Hang, Laura Casas, William d'Assignies, Wynne Turner, Andreu Font-Ribera, Benjamin Joachimi | 2026-01-23 | Responsible AI, Model Evaluation | We explore the feasibility of using Lyman-$α$ (Ly$α$) forests to calibrate the ensemble redshift distribution of the high-redshift tail ($2<z<3$) of photometric galaxies. We use \texttt{CoLoRe} simulations to create mock DESI 5-year Ly$α$ forests and Rubin Observatory LSST 10-year photometric galaxies up to $z=3$, and measure the galaxy redshift distribution via their angular cross-correlations. Due to large redshift-space distortions in the Ly$α$ forest, the conventional $n(z)$ estimator for clustering redshifts does not apply, and we develope a theoretical framework to model the angular cross-correlation directly. Using the simulations, we explore effects of instrumental noise, continuum fitting, and contamination in the Ly$α$ forest, cross-correlation angular scales ($θ$), and redshift bin size ($Δz$) on the signal-to-noise (SNR) of the measurements. We find that continuum fitting methods strongly impact the SNR of the measurements. With our baseline continuum fitting method, \texttt{LyCAN}, at angular scales $θ\sim10$ arcmin and $Δz=0.1$, we measure the cross-correlation signal at $24σ$. If the shape of the redshift distribution and galaxy bias evolution are known well for $z<2$, the cross-correlation can constrain the mean redshift of the galaxy sample to $σ_z/(1+\bar{z}) = 0.006$ at a mean redshift of $\bar{z}=2$. This demonstrates that Ly$α$ cross-correlation is a reliable and promising method to calibrate the high-redshift tails of photometric Stage IV galaxy surveys. | [🔗 Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16962v1) |
| [Improving constraints on primordial non-Gaussianity from Quaia with a new cosmological observable: angular redshift fluctuations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16948v1) | José Ramón Bermejo-Climent, Carlos Hernández-Monteagudo, Alba Crespo-Pérez, Jorge Martin Camalich, David Alonso, Giulio Fabbian, Kate Storey-Fisher | 2026-01-23 | Responsible AI, Model Evaluation | Angular redshift fluctuations (ARF) are a new cosmological observable, recently proposed in the literature. It measures the 2D angular deviations of the average redshift of a given matter tracer under an input redshift shell. Since it depends on the galaxy bias, it can be used to constrain primordial non-Gaussianity through the scale-dependent bias effect. We analyze a sample of quasars built upon the Gaia satellite and unWISE data, Quaia, to measure the local non-Gaussianity parameter $f_{\rm NL}$. This sample is particularly suitable for measuring $f_{\rm NL}$ due to its large volume coverage. We measure the ARF power spectra from the Quaia catalog and combine their information with the 2D (projected) galaxy density and their cross-correlation with the $Planck$ PR4 CMB lensing maps lensing to jointly constrain $f_{\rm NL}$. Assuming the universality relation, we measure $f_{\rm NL} = -3 \pm 14$ at 68% confidence level by combining Quaia quasar angular density and ARF with the CMB lensing. This result is the second tightest constraint on $f_{\rm NL}$ using LSS two-point statistics to date and the best measurement achieved using two-point projected summary statistics, improving by $\sim$25% the previous measurement from Quaia. Our results motivate the inclusion of ARF as an additional cosmological observable in future 2D analysis of upcoming datasets from large surveys. | [🔗 Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16948v1) |

| [Post-Perihelion Integral Field Spectroscopy of the Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16983v1) | Willem B. Hoogendam, David O. Jones, Bin Yang, Benjamin J. Shappee, James J. Wray, Karen J. Meech, Christopher Ashall, Dhvanil D. Desai, Jason T. Hinkle, Andrew M. Hoffman, Kyle Medler, Cameron Pfeffer, Ruining Zhao | 2026-01-23 | General AI | The environs of other stellar systems may be directly probed by analyzing the cometary activity of interstellar objects. The recently discovered interstellar object 3I/ATLAS was the subject of an intensive worldwide follow-up campaign in its pre-perihelion approach. Now, 3I/ATLAS has begun its post-perihelion departure from the Solar System. In this letter, we report the first post-perihelion blue-sensitive integral-field unit spectroscopy of 3I/ATLAS using the Keck Cosmic Web Imager on November 16, 2025. We confirm previously reported CN, Fe, and Ni outgassing along with detections of carbon chain molecules $\mathrm{C}_2$ and $\mathrm{C}_3$. We calculate production rates for each species. We find Fe and Ni production rates of $\mathrm{Q_{Fe}} = (9.55\pm3.96)\times10^{25}$ atoms s$^{-1}$, and $\mathrm{Q_{Ni}} = (6.61\pm2.74)\times10^{25}$ atoms s$^{-1}$, resulting in a ratio of $\log(\mathrm{Q_{Ni}} / \mathrm{Q_{Fe}}) = -0.16\pm0.03$, which matches Solar System comets well and continues the pre-perihelion trend of declining $\log(\mathrm{Q_{Ni}} / \mathrm{Q_{Fe}})$ with $r_h$. We investigate the radial distributions of these elemental species and find characteristic $e$-folding radii of 3880$\pm$39 km for Ni, 6053$\pm$68 km for CN, 4194$\pm$45 km for $\mathrm{C}_2$, and 3833$\pm$45 km for $\mathrm{C}_3$. Compared to pre-perihelion measurements, these radii have increased by a factor of $\sim$6.5--7. Our post-perihelion observations reveal that 3I/ATLAS continues to exhibit cometary behavior broadly consistent with Solar System comets. | [🔗 Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16983v1) |
| [Tunable Edelstein effect in intrinsic two-dimensional ferroelectric metal PtBi$_{2}$](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16980v1) | Weiyi Pan, Jaroslav Fabian | 2026-01-23 | General AI | The Edelstein effect, which enables charge-to-spin conversion and is therefore highly promising for future spintronic devices, can be realized and non-volatilely manipulated in ferroelectric materials owing to their broken inversion symmetry and switchable polarization states. To date, most ferroelectric systems reported to exhibit the Edelstein effect are semiconductors, requiring extrinsic doping for functionality. In contrast, the Edelstein effect has rarely been reported in metallic ferroelectric systems, where doping is unnecessary. Using first-principles calculations, we predict that a pronounced Edelstein effect can be realized in the recently proposed intrinsic two-dimensional ferroelectric metal PtBi$_{2}$ monolayer, where the sign of the Edelstein coefficient is coupled to the direction of ferroelectric polarization through the polarization-switching-induced reversal of spin textures, thereby enabling non-volatile control of charge-spin conversion. The Edelstein effect reaches a magnitude of $10^{11}~\hbar/(\textup{A} \cdot \textup{cm})$, which is sizable compared to previously reported ferroelectric systems. Microscopically, the Edelstein effect in a PtBi$_2$ monolayer originates from competing contributions of inner Rashba-like electron pockets and outer hole pockets with opposite signs; an upward shift of the Fermi level alters their balance and can reverse the sign of the Edelstein effect. Upon applying biaxial strain, the Fermi-surface electronic structure is strongly modified, resulting in a pronounced change of the Edelstein effect: a 2 \% compressive strain suppresses the Edelstein effect by about 50 \%. Our results not only identify a promising material platform for tunable charge-spin conversion but also provide new insights into the functional potential of metallic ferroelectric systems. | [🔗 Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16980v1) |
| [Black Carbon scavenging in liquid Arctic clouds: the role of size and mixing state](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16978v1) | Barbara Bertozzi, Robin L. Modini, Radovan Krejci, Gabriel Pereira Freitas, Rosaria E. Pileci, Paul Zieger, Martin Gysel-Beer | 2026-01-23 | General AI | Black carbon (BC) contributes to Arctic warming by absorbing sunlight and darkening snow. Its atmospheric lifetime critically determines its concentration and climate impact, yet the processes controlling its removal remain poorly constrained in the Arctic. From 18 months of single-particle measurements at the Zeppelin Observatory (Svalbard), we analysed 37 liquid cloud events (~200 hours) to investigate the link between BC properties and in-cloud scavenging, providing the most extensive in-cloud single particle BC dataset to date. While large BC cores (DrBC>200 nm) were consistently scavenged, smaller cores were only partly removed. However, even thin soluble coatings significantly enhanced their scavenging, showing that mixing state modulates BC scavenging in the CCN-limited regime typical of Arctic low-level clouds. Seasonal variability in clear sky BC mixing state further suggests corresponding changes in scavenging efficiency. Our results demonstrate that besides size, the size-resolved BC mixing state is a key variable for BC scavenging in the Arctic and models should take it into consideration to accurately predict BC-cloud interaction. | [🔗 Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16978v1) |
| [Explicit Brauer-Manin obstructions on plane quartics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16975v1) | Nils Bruin, Brendan Creutz | 2026-01-23 | General AI | We describe a method to show a plane quartic over a number field has no rational points. The method can be adapted to show that a curve does not have divisors of degree 1 or 2 and can be generalized to arbitrary smooth projective curves. Our approach significantly improves on the applicability over previous 2-cover descent methods by not requiring the computation of the full $S$-unit group of the étale algebras involved. We illustrate the practicality with several examples, including examples where we determine plane quartics to be of index 2 or 4 when the maximum local index is strictly smaller. | [🔗 Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16975v1) |
| [Formalising an operational continuum limit of quantum combs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16974v1) | Clara Wassner, Jonáš Fuksa, Jens Eisert, Gregory A. L. White | 2026-01-23 | General AI | Quantum combs are powerful conceptual tools for capturing multi-time processes in quantum information theory, constituting the most general quantum mechanical process. But, despite their causal nature, they lack a meaningful physical connection to time -- and are, by and large, arguably incompatible with it without extra structure. The subclass of quantum combs which assumes an underlying process is described by the so-called process tensor framework, which has been successfully used to study and characterise non-Markovian open quantum systems. But, although process tensors are motivated by an underlying dynamics, it is not a priori clear how to connect to a continuous process tensor object mathematically -- leaving an uncomfortable conceptual gap. In this work, we take a decisive step toward remedying this situation. We introduce a fully continuous process tensor framework by showing how the discrete multi-partite Choi state becomes a field-theoretic state in bosonic Fock space, which is intrinsically and rigorously defined in the continuum. With this equipped, we lay out the core structural elements of this framework and its properties. This translation allows for an information-theoretic treatment of multi-time correlations in the continuum via the analysis of their continuous matrix product state representatives. Our work closes a gap in the quantum information literature, and opens up the opportunity for the application of many-body physics insights to our understanding of quantum stochastic processes in the continuum. | [🔗 Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16974v1) |
| [Embedding Wormholes and Dyonic Black Strings in Warped Braneworlds via Local Sum Rules](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16969v1) | G. Alencar, T. M. Crispim, Francisco S. N. Lobo | 2026-01-23 | General AI | Building on our previous work [1], where the Local Sum Rules (LSR) were established, we investigate the construction of compact objects in Randall-Sundrum braneworlds supported by matter fields that are dynamically consistent and localizable. We begin by revisiting the Chamblin et al. black string, highlighting its role as a foundational higher-dimensional solution. We then show that the Ellis-Bronnikov wormhole can be consistently embedded in this framework via a localized free scalar field, providing a simple yet nontrivial example of a braneworld compact object. Finally, we derive two novel black string solutions sourced by a localized nonlinear electrodynamics (NED) theory with Lagrangian $\mathcal{L}(\mathcal{F}) = -β\sqrt{\mathcal{F}}$, corresponding to purely magnetic and dyonic configurations. The purely magnetic solution reproduces the classical Letelier string cloud on the brane, while the dyonic solution generalizes it to include electric charge, closely paralleling the Letelier-Alencar construction. Both NED solutions reduce smoothly to the Chamblin et al. black string in the limit $β\to 0$, illustrating how localized higher-dimensional matter fields can consistently support braneworld compact objects and connect higher-dimensional physics with well-known four-dimensional solutions. | [🔗 Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16969v1) |

However, existing LLM-based agents often fail at genuine geospatial computation, relying instead on web search or pattern matching while hallucinating spatial relationships. We present Spatial-Agent, an AI agent grounded in foundational theories of spatial information science. Our approach formalizes geo-analytical question answering as a concept transformation problem, where natural-language questions are parsed into executable workflows represented as GeoFlow Graphs -- directed acyclic graphs with nodes corresponding to spatial concepts and edges representing transformations. Drawing on spatial information theory, Spatial-Agent extracts spatial concepts, assigns functional roles with principled ordering constraints, and composes transformation sequences through template-based generation. Extensive experiments on MapEval-API and MapQA benchmarks demonstrate that Spatial-Agent significantly outperforms existing baselines including ReAct and Reflexion, while producing interpretable and executable geospatial workflows. | [🔗 Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16965v1) |
| [Engineering discrete local dynamics in globally driven dual-species atom arrays](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16961v1) | Francesco Cesa, Andrea Di Fini, David Aram Korbany, Roberto Tricarico, Hannes Bernien, Hannes Pichler, Lorenzo Piroli | 2026-01-23 | General AI | We introduce a method for engineering discrete local dynamics in globally-driven dual-species neutral atom experiments, allowing us to study emergent digital models through uniform analog controls. Leveraging the new opportunities offered by dual-species systems, such as species-alternated driving, our construction exploits simple Floquet protocols on static atom arrangements, and benefits of generalized blockade regimes (different inter- and intra-species interactions). We focus on discrete dynamical models that are special examples of Quantum Cellular Automata (QCA), and explicitly consider a number of relevant examples, including the kicked-Ising model, the Floquet Kitaev honeycomb model, and the digitization of generic translation-invariant nearest-neighbor Hamiltonians (e.g., for Trotterized evolution). As an application, we study chaotic features of discretized many-body dynamics that can be detected by leveraging only demonstrated capabilities of globally-driven experiments, and benchmark their ability to discriminate chaotic evolution. | [🔗 Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16961v1) |
| [Do We Know What They Know We Know? Calibrating Student Trust in AI and Human Responses Through Mutual Theory of Mind](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16960v1) | Olivia Pal, Veda Duddu, Agam Goyal, Drishti Goel, Koustuv Saha | 2026-01-23 | General AI | Trust and reliance are often treated as coupled constructs in human-AI interaction research, with the assumption that calibrating trust will lead to appropriate reliance. We challenge this assumption in educational contexts, where students increasingly turn to AI for learning support. Through semi-structured interviews with graduate students (N=8) comparing AI-generated and human-generated responses, we find a systematic dissociation: students exhibit high trust but low reliance on human experts due to social barriers (fear of judgment, help-seeking anxiety), while showing low trust but high reliance on AI systems due to social affordances (accessibility, anonymity, judgment-free interaction). Using Mutual Theory of Mind as an analytical lens, we demonstrate that trust is shaped by epistemic evaluations while reliance is driven by social factors -- and these may operate independently. | [🔗 Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16960v1) |
| [Probabilistic Graphical Models in Astronomy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16959v1) | Abigail Sheerin, Giuseppe Vinci | 2026-01-23 | General AI | The field of astronomy is experiencing a data explosion driven by significant advances in observational instrumentation, and classical methods often fall short of addressing the complexity of modern astronomical datasets. Probabilistic graphical models offer powerful tools for uncovering the dependence structures and data-generating processes underlying a wide array of cosmic variables. By representing variables as nodes in a network, these models allow for the visualization and analysis of the intricate relationships that underpin theories of hierarchical structure formation within the universe. We highlight the value that graphical models bring to astronomical research by demonstrating their practical application to the study of exoplanets and host stars. | [🔗 Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16959v1) |
| [3D Molecule Generation from Rigid Motifs via SE(3) Flows](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16955v1) | Roman Poletukhin, Marcel Kollovieh, Eike Eberhard, Stephan Günnemann | 2026-01-23 | General AI | Three-dimensional molecular structure generation is typically performed at the level of individual atoms, yet molecular graph generation techniques often consider fragments as their structural units. Building on the advances in frame-based protein structure generation, we extend these fragmentation ideas to 3D, treating general molecules as sets of rigid-body motifs. Utilising this representation, we employ SE(3)-equivariant generative modelling for de novo 3D molecule generation from rigid motifs. In our evaluations, we observe comparable or superior results to state-of-the-art across benchmarks, surpassing it in atom stability on GEOM-Drugs, while yielding a 2x to 10x reduction in generation steps and offering 3.5x compression in molecular representations compared to the standard atom-based methods. | [🔗 Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16955v1) |
| [Distribution of independent sets in perfect $r$-ary trees](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16953v1) | Daniel Iľkovič, Jun Yan | 2026-01-23 | General AI | Given a graph $G$, the family of all independent sets of size $k$ containing a fixed vertex $v$ is called a star with centre $v$, and is denoted by $\mathcal{I}_G^k(v)$. Motivated by a generalisation of the Erdős-Ko-Rado Theorem to the setting of independent sets in graphs, Hurlbert and Kamat conjectured that for every tree $T$ and every $k$, the maximum of $ \mathcal{I}_T^k(v) $ can always be attained by a leaf of $T$. While this conjecture turns out to be false in general, it is known to hold for specific families of trees like spiders and caterpillars. In this paper, we prove that this conjecture holds for a new family of trees, the perfect $r$-ary trees, by constructing injections from stars centred at arbitrary vertices to stars centred at leaves. We also show that the analogous property holds for every forest $\mathcal{T}$ that is the disjoint union of perfect trees with possibly varying sizes and arities, and determine the leaf that maximises $ \mathcal{I}_{\mathcal{T}}^k(v) $. | [🔗 Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16953v1) |
| [Experimental investigation of nonclassicality in the simplest scenario via the degrees of freedom of light](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16952v1) | João M. M. Gama, Guilherme T. C. Cruz, Massy Khoshbin, Lorenzo Catani, José A. O. Huguenin, Wagner F. Balthazar | 2026-01-23 | General AI | In this work, we experimentally investigate the classical-light emulation of different notions of nonclassicality in the simplest scenario. We implement this prepare-and-measure scenario involving four preparations and two binary-outcome measurements using two distinct experimental setups that exploit different degrees of freedom of light: polarization and first-order Hermite-Gaussian transverse modes. We additionally model experimental noise through an all-optical setup that reproduces the operational effect of a depolarizing channel. Our experimental results are consistent with the findings of Khoshbin et al. [Phys. Rev. A 109, 032212 (2024)]: under the assumption that the two measurements performed form a tomographically complete set, the observed statistics violate their noise-robust inequalities, indicating inconsistencies with preparation noncontextuality and bounded ontological distinctness for preparations. Although our implementation uses classical light, it reproduces the statistics predicted for the simplest scenario. Since the states and measurements of this scenario underpin computational advantages in tasks such as two-bit quantum random access codes -- among the simplest communication primitives enabling semi-device-independent certification of nonclassicality -- our implementation is directly relevant for such applications. | [🔗 Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16952v1) |

Based on the $\mathbb{Z}_2$-orbifold of the $c=1$ compactified boson boundary conformal field theory, we construct microscopic lattice boundary terms that renormalize to the stable conformal boundary conditions,, utilizing simple current extensions and the underlying $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ symmetry to explicitly characterize the four-state Potts point. We validate these theoretical identifications via finite-size spectroscopy of the lattice energy spectra, confirming their consistency with $D_4$ symmetry and Kramers-Wannier duality. Finally, we discuss the boundary renormalization group flows among these identified fixed points to propose a global phase diagram for the boundary criticality. | [🔗 Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16951v1) |
| [Simulating Electron Dynamics with GPU-Accelerated Real-Time Tamm-Dancoff Approximation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16949v1) | Thomas Knoll, Benjamin G. Levine | 2026-01-23 | General AI | Time-dependent electronic structure methods provide an efficient, accurate, and robust alternative to traditional time dependent methods for computing both linear and non-linear optical properties. With this in mind, we have developed the real-time Tamm-Dancoff approximation (RT-TDA). This is an approach to model electron dynamics by propagating the linear-response time-dependent density functional theory (LR-TDDFT) amplitudes within the Tamm-Dancoff approximation (TDA) and adiabatic approximation. Because the electronic structure is propagated in real-time in a many-electron basis, RT-TDA overcomes known limitations of adiabatic Kohn-Sham RT-TDDFT for describing dynamics in intense fields. Acceleration by graphic processing units (GPUs) enables simulations of larger molecules and on longer timescales. To demonstrate the utility of our approach, we present the calculations of the linear absorption spectrum of a large organic molecule (120 heavy atoms), of Rabi oscillations, and of nonlinear 2-photon absorption, in which we observe the AC Stark effect. | [🔗 Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16949v1) |
| [On the Hausdorff stability of barcodes over posets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16947v1) | Mujtaba Ali, Tom Needham, Anastasios Stefanou, Ling Zhou | 2026-01-23 | General AI | The Isometry Theorem of Chazal et al. and Lesnick is a fundamental result in persistence theory, which states that the interleaving distance between two one-parameter persistence modules is equal to the bottleneck distance between their barcodes. Significant effort has been devoted to extending this result to modules defined over more general posets. As these modules do not generally admit nice decompositions, one must restrict attention to the class of interval-decomposable modules in order to define an appropriate notion of bottleneck distance. Even with this assumption, it is known that bottleneck distance may not be equivalent to interleaving distance, but that it is Lipschitz stable under certain, fairly restrictive, assumptions. In this paper, we consider the more basic question of stability of the Hausdorff distance with respect to interleaving distance for interval-decomposable modules. Our main theorem is a Lipschitz stability result, which holds in a fairly general setting of interval-decomposable modules over arbitrary posets, where intervals are assumed to be taken from any family satisfying certain closure conditions. Along the way, we develop some new tools and results for interval-decomposable modules over arbitrary posets, in the form of geometrically-flavored characterizations of the existence of morphisms and interleavings between interval modules. | [🔗 Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16947v1) |
| [Strategies for Span Labeling with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16946v1) | Danil Semin, Ondřej Dušek, Zdeněk Kasner | 2026-01-23 | General AI | Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for text analysis tasks, such as named entity recognition or error detection. Unlike encoder-based models, however, generative architectures lack an explicit mechanism to refer to specific parts of their input. This leads to a variety of ad-hoc prompting strategies for span labeling, often with inconsistent results. In this paper, we categorize these strategies into three families: tagging the input text, indexing numerical positions of spans, and matching span content. To address the limitations of content matching, we introduce LogitMatch, a new constrained decoding method that forces the model's output to align with valid input spans. We evaluate all methods across four diverse tasks. We find that while tagging remains a robust baseline, LogitMatch improves upon competitive matching-based methods by eliminating span matching issues and outperforms other strategies in some setups. | [🔗 Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16946v1) |
| [Atkin polynomials for families of abelian varieties with real multiplication](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16944v1) | Gabriele Bogo, Yingkun Li | 2026-01-23 | General AI | Generalizing the work of Atkin and Kaneko-Zagier in the elliptic case, we describe the non-ordinary locus of a genus-zero non-compact curve $Y$ in a Hilbert modular variety in terms of the zeros of generalized Atkin's orthogonal polynomials. The argument relies on the recent construction of lifts of partial Hasse invariants for $Y$. We further describe these orthogonal polynomials as denominators of Padé approximants to the logarithmic derivatives of solutions of the Picard-Fuchs differential equations associated with $Y$. This provides a new link between Padé approximation and the geometry of the non-ordinary locus, extending a classical observation of Igusa for the Legendre family and applying, in particular, to situations where the Picard-Fuchs equations do not admit modular solutions. As applications, we determine the three-term recurrence relations for Atkin polynomials attached to triangle curves via hypergeometric identities, and compute the supersingular locus of a double cover of the Teichmüller curve $W_{17}$. In the latter case, we conjecture that the associated supersingular polynomial is self-reciprocal, implying that supersingular points occur in pairs. | [🔗 Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16944v1) |

Hruszkewycz, Nuh Gedik, Di Xiao, Hyunjung Kim, Xiaodong Xu, Haidan Wen | 2026-01-23 | General AI | Magnetoelastic coupling in van der Waals (vdW) magnetic materials enables a unique interplay between the spin and lattice degrees of freedom. Characterizing the elastic responses with atomic and femtosecond resolution across the magnetic transition is essential for guiding the design of magnetically tunable actuators and strain-mediated spintronic devices. Here, ultrafast x-ray diffraction employed at a free-electron laser reveals that the atomic displacements, wave vectors, and dispersion relations of acoustic phonon modes in a vdW antiferromagnet FePS$_3$ are coupled with the magnetic order, by tracking both in-plane and out-of-plane Bragg peaks upon optical excitation across the Néel temperature (T$_N$). One transverse mode shows that a quasi-out-of-plane atomic displacement undergoes a significant directional change across T$_N$. Its quasi-in-plane wave vector is derived by the comparison between the measured sound velocity and the first-principles calculations. The other transverse mode is an interlayer shear acoustic mode whose amplitude is strongly enhanced in the antiferromagnetic phase, exhibiting eight times stronger amplitude than the longitudinal acoustic mode below T$_N$. The atomically resolved characterization of acoustic phonon dynamics that couple with magnetic ordering opens opportunities for harnessing unique magnetoelastic coupling in vdW magnets on ultrafast timescales. | [🔗 Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16942v1) |
| [Quantum Fisher information analysis for absorption measurements with undetected photons](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16941v1) | Martin Houde, Franz Roeder, Christine Silberhorn, Benjamin Brecht, Nicolás Quesada | 2026-01-23 | General AI | We theoretically compare the quantum Fisher information (QFI) for three configurations of absorption spectroscopy with undetected idler photons: an SU(1,1) interferometer with inter-source idler loss, an induced-coherence (IC) setup in which the idler partially seeds a second squeezer together with a vacuum ancilla, and a distributed-loss (DL) scheme with in-medium attenuation. We calculate the QFI as a function of parametric gain for both full and signal-only detection access. For losses below 99% and low to moderate gain, the SU(1,1) configuration provides the largest QFI. At high gain and intermediate loss, the IC scheme performs best, while under extreme attenuation (transmission $<$ 1%) the DL model becomes optimal. These results delineate the measurement regimes in which each architecture is optimal in terms of information theory. | [🔗 Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16941v1) |
| [Connecting bond switching to fracture toughness of calcium aluminosilicate glasses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16940v1) | Sidsel Mulvad Johansen, Tao Du, Johan F. S. Christensen, Anders K. R. Christensen, Xuan Ge, Theany To, Lars R. Jensen, Morten M. Smedskjaer | 2026-01-23 | General AI | Fracture toughness is a critical mechanical property of glasses, but a detailed understanding of its link to composition and structure is still missing. Here, focusing on the industrially important family of calcium aluminosilicate glasses, we measure the fracture toughness of two glass series using the single-edge precracked beam method, one based on tectosilicate compositions with varying silica contents and the other covering both percalcic and peraluminous compositions with varying Al/Ca ratio. To elucidate the structural origins of the variation in fracture toughness, we perform X-ray total scattering measurements and molecular dynamics simulations. Our findings show that local coordination changes of especially Al atoms, so-called bond switching, feature an overall positive correlation with fracture toughness. We also compare this variation with that in other mechanical properties, including elastic moduli, hardness, and crack initiation resistance. We find that various structural aspects need to be considered to describe and understand the mechanical properties of calcium aluminosilicate glasses. | [🔗 Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16940v1) |

These sheaves are a motivic variant of geometric extensions, and provide a replacement for parity sheaves on the Richardson variety. We also provide an explicit formula for these multiplicities in terms of $\ell$-Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials. | [🔗 Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16937v1) |
| [AERO: Adaptive and Efficient Runtime-Aware OTA Updates for Energy-Harvesting IoT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16935v1) | Wei Wei, Jingye Xu, Sahidul Islam, Dakai Zhu, Chen Pan, Mimi Xie | 2026-01-23 | General AI | Energy-harvesting (EH) Internet of Things (IoT) devices operate under intermittent energy availability, which disrupts task execution and makes energy-intensive over-the-air (OTA) updates particularly challenging. Conventional OTA update mechanisms rely on reboots and incur significant overhead, rendering them unsuitable for intermittently powered systems. Recent live OTA update techniques reduce reboot overhead but still lack mechanisms to ensure consistency when updates interact with runtime execution. This paper presents AERO, an Adaptive and Efficient Runtime-Aware OTA update mechanism that integrates update tasks into the device's Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) and schedules them alongside routine tasks under energy and timing constraints. By identifying update-affected execution regions and dynamically adjusting dependencies, AERO ensures consistent up date integration while adapting to intermittent energy availability. Experiments on representative workloads demonstrate improved update reliability and efficiency compared to existing live update approaches. | [🔗 Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16935v1) |

Graffy, Benjamin W. Barrett, Daniel E. Horton, Jennifer L. Chan, Abel N. Kho | 2026-01-23 | General AI | Extreme heat is an escalating public health concern. Although prior studies have examined heat-health associations, their reliance on restricted diagnoses and diagnostic categories misses or misclassifies heat-related illness. We conducted a heat-wide association study to identify acute-care diagnoses associated with extreme heat in Chicago, Illinois. Using 916,904 acute-care visits -- including emergency department and urgent care encounters -- among 372,140 adults across five healthcare systems from 2011-2023, we applied a two-stage analytic approach: quasi-Poisson regression to screen 1,803 diagnosis codes for heat-related risks, followed by distributed lag non-linear models in a time-stratified case-crossover design to refine the list of heat-related diagnoses and estimate same-day and short-term cumulative odds ratios of acute-care visits during extreme heat versus reference temperature. We observed same-day increases in visits for heat illness, volume depletion, hypotension, edema, acute kidney failure, and multiple injuries. By analyzing the full diagnostic spectrum of acute-care services, this study comprehensively characterizes heat-associated morbidity, reinforcing and advancing existing literature. | [🔗 Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16932v1) |
