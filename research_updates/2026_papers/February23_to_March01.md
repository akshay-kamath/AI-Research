| [SafeGen-LLM: Enhancing Safety Generalization in Task Planning for Robotic Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.24235v1) | Jialiang Fan, Weizhe Xu, Mengyu Liu, Oleg Sokolsky, Insup Lee, Fangxin Kong | 2026-02-27 | LLM, RLHF, Fine-Tuning, Optimization | Safety-critical task planning in robotic systems remains challenging: classical planners suffer from poor scalability, Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based methods generalize poorly, and base Large Language Models (LLMs) cannot guarantee safety. To address this gap, we propose safety-generalizable large language models, named SafeGen-LLM. SafeGen-LLM can not only enhance the safety satisfaction of task plans but also generalize well to novel safety properties in various domains. We first construct a multi-domain Planning Domain Definition Language 3 (PDDL3) benchmark with explicit safety constraints. Then, we introduce a two-stage post-training framework: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on a constraint-compliant planning dataset to learn planning syntax and semantics, and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) guided by fine-grained reward machines derived from formal verification to enforce safety alignment and by curriculum learning to better handle complex tasks. Extensive experiments show that SafeGen-LLM achieves strong safety generalization and outperforms frontier proprietary baselines across multi-domain planning tasks and multiple input formats (e.g., PDDLs and natural language). | [🔗 Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.24235v1) |
| [MuViT: Multi-Resolution Vision Transformers for Learning Across Scales in Microscopy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.24222v1) | Albert Dominguez Mantes, Gioele La Manno, Martin Weigert | 2026-02-27 | LLM | Modern microscopy routinely produces gigapixel images that contain structures across multiple spatial scales, from fine cellular morphology to broader tissue organization. Many analysis tasks require combining these scales, yet most vision models operate at a single resolution or derive multi-scale features from one view, limiting their ability to exploit the inherently multi-resolution nature of microscopy data. We introduce MuViT, a transformer architecture built to fuse true multi-resolution observations from the same underlying image. MuViT embeds all patches into a shared world-coordinate system and extends rotary positional embeddings to these coordinates, enabling attention to integrate wide-field context with high-resolution detail within a single encoder. Across synthetic benchmarks, kidney histopathology, and high-resolution mouse-brain microscopy, MuViT delivers consistent improvements over strong ViT and CNN baselines. Multi-resolution MAE pretraining further produces scale-consistent representations that enhance downstream tasks. These results demonstrate that explicit world-coordinate modelling provides a simple yet powerful mechanism for leveraging multi-resolution information in large-scale microscopy analysis. | [🔗 Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.24222v1) |

| [SenCache: Accelerating Diffusion Model Inference via Sensitivity-Aware Caching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.24208v1) | Yasaman Haghighi, Alexandre Alahi | 2026-02-27 | Multimodal AI, Diffusion Models | Diffusion models achieve state-of-the-art video generation quality, but their inference remains expensive due to the large number of sequential denoising steps. This has motivated a growing line of research on accelerating diffusion inference. Among training-free acceleration methods, caching reduces computation by reusing previously computed model outputs across timesteps. Existing caching methods rely on heuristic criteria to choose cache/reuse timesteps and require extensive tuning. We address this limitation with a principled sensitivity-aware caching framework. Specifically, we formalize the caching error through an analysis of the model output sensitivity to perturbations in the denoising inputs, i.e., the noisy latent and the timestep, and show that this sensitivity is a key predictor of caching error. Based on this analysis, we propose Sensitivity-Aware Caching (SenCache), a dynamic caching policy that adaptively selects caching timesteps on a per-sample basis. Our framework provides a theoretical basis for adaptive caching, explains why prior empirical heuristics can be partially effective, and extends them to a dynamic, sample-specific approach. Experiments on Wan 2.1, CogVideoX, and LTX-Video show that SenCache achieves better visual quality than existing caching methods under similar computational budgets. | [🔗 Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.24208v1) |
| [Uncertainty Quantification for Multimodal Large Language Models with Incoherence-adjusted Semantic Volume](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.24195v1) | Gregory Kang Ruey Lau, Hieu Dao, Nicole Kan Hui Lin, Bryan Kian Hsiang Low | 2026-02-27 | Multimodal AI, Ongoing Learning | Despite their capabilities, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) may produce plausible but erroneous outputs, hindering reliable deployment. Accurate uncertainty metrics could enable escalation of unreliable queries to human experts or larger models for improved performance. However, existing uncertainty metrics have practical constraints, such as being designed only for specific modalities, reliant on external tools, or computationally expensive. We introduce UMPIRE, a training-free uncertainty quantification framework for MLLMs that works efficiently across various input and output modalities without external tools, relying only on the models' own internal modality features. UMPIRE computes the incoherence-adjusted semantic volume of sampled MLLM responses for a given task instance, effectively capturing both the global semantic diversity of samples and the local incoherence of responses based on internal model confidence. We propose uncertainty desiderata for MLLMs and provide theoretical analysis motivating UMPIRE's design. Extensive experiments show that UMPIRE consistently outperforms baseline metrics in error detection and uncertainty calibration across image, audio, and video-text benchmarks, including adversarial and out-of-distribution settings. We also demonstrate UMPIRE's generalization to non-text output tasks, including image and audio generation. | [🔗 Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.24195v1) |

| [Mechanism-Resolved PFM of Ferroionic and Ferroelectric Responses in Thickness-Gradient Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 Libraries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.24216v1) | Yu Liu, Yi-Xiu Chen, Haotong Liang, Ichiro Takeuchi, Sergei V. Kalinin | 2026-02-27 | Optimization | Resolving growth mechanisms and thickness evolution of functional properties is one of the key tasks in materials discovery and optimization involving thin-film materials, traditionally requiring significant experimental budgets. Here we introduce the combination of thickness-gradient libraries and automated scanning probe microscopy as a systematic pathway to elucidate growth modes and disentangle ferroelectric and electrochemical contributions in ferroelectric thin films. As a model system, we explore the Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 (HZO) gradient thin films grown on LaxSr1-xMnO3 (LSMO) bottom electrode thin films. Automated piezoresponse force microscopy, spectroscopy, and lithography reveals that irreversible topographic deformation arises from electrochemical activity at the LSMO surface, whereas reversible phase inversion in HZO reflects ferroelectric switching. Automated topography height-map scans are used to further quantify nucleation density, particle-size evolution, and roughness correlations across the thickness-gradient, demonstrating that improved plume stabilization during growth suppresses interfacial reactions and promotes dense, fine-grained HZO conducive to ferroelectric phase formation. This combined materials-engineering and automated-SPM framework establishes a platform for high-throughput, mechanism-resolved characterization of ferroionic and ferroelectric responses in complex oxide films. | [🔗 Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.24216v1) |
| [The Stability of Online Algorithms in Performative Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.24207v1) | Gabriele Farina, Juan Carlos Perdomo | 2026-02-27 | Optimization | The use of algorithmic predictions in decision-making leads to a feedback loop where the models we deploy actively influence the data distributions we see, and later use to retrain on. This dynamic was formalized by Perdomo et al. 2020 in their work on performative prediction. Our main result is an unconditional reduction showing that any no-regret algorithm deployed in performative settings converges to a (mixed) performatively stable equilibrium: a solution in which models actively shape data distributions in ways that their own predictions look optimal in hindsight. Prior to our work, all positive results in this area made strong restrictions on how models influenced distributions. By using a martingale argument and allowing randomization, we avoid any such assumption and sidestep recent hardness results for finding stable models. Lastly, on a more conceptual note, our connection sheds light on why common algorithms, like gradient descent, are naturally stabilizing and prevent runaway feedback loops. We hope our work enables future technical transfer of ideas between online optimization and performativity. | [🔗 Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.24207v1) |

| [Effective Three-Boson Interactions using a Separable Potential](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.24226v1) | Corinne Beckers, Jacques Tempere, Jeff Maki, Denise Ahmed-Braun | 2026-02-27 | Scaling Laws | Effective field theories (EFTs) are widely used to study many-body systems by describing two-body interactions using zero-ranged contact potentials. However, when extended to three-body processes, these contact interactions lead to divergences due to the absence of an intrinsic length scale. In EFT, this is typically resolved by introducing a zero-ranged three-body interaction, which can be renormalized to make the low-energy physics independent of the short-distance physics. However, when the two-body potential has a finite range, such as in separable potentials, there is no need for such renormalization. In this work, we derive the integral equation for the three-body scattering amplitude for separable potentials, and solve it in the strongly-interacting regime. With our model, we retrieve the known analytic form of the scattering amplitude for inelastic scattering processes and formulate a new scaling law for elastic three-body scattering processes. | [🔗 Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.24226v1) |
| [Empirical Challenges with Peers-of-Peers Instruments in the Linear-In-Means Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.24215v1) | Nathan Canen, Shantanu Chadha | 2026-02-27 | Scaling Laws | In the linear-in-means model, endogeneity arises naturally due to the reflection problem. A common solution is to use Instrumental Variables (IVs) based on higher-order network links, such as using friends-of-friends' characteristics. We first show that such instruments are unlikely to work well in many applied settings: in very sparse or very dense networks, friends-of-friends may be similar to the original links. This implies that the IVs may be weak or their first stage estimand may be undefined. For a class of random graphs, we use random graph theory and characterize regimes where such instruments perform well, and when they would not. We prove how weak-IV robust inference can be adapted to this environment, and how scaling the network can help. We provide extensive Monte Carlo simulations and revisit empirical applications, showing the prevalence of such issues in empirical practice, and how our results restore valid inference. | [🔗 Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.24215v1) |
| [Discovery of a nearby radio relic in the low-mass, merging cluster Abell 4067](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.24206v1) | Isaac Magolego, Roger P. Deane, Kshitij Thorat, Ian Heywood, Justin Spilker, Taweewat Somboonpanyakul, Dazhi Zhou, Manuel Aravena, Joaquin D. Vieira, Kedar A. Phadke, Lindsey E. Bleem, Scott C. Chapman | 2026-02-27 | Scaling Laws | Shock waves generated during cluster mergers offer a powerful probe of how large-scale structure grows and evolves in the Universe. As part of the MeerKAT-South Pole Telescope (SPT) survey, we report the discovery of a single arc-like radio relic in the galaxy cluster Abell 4067 ($z=0.099$), one of the lowest-mass clusters known to host such a structure. MeerKAT UHF-band (0.58--1.09 GHz) observations reveal a relic with a largest linear size of $\sim 1.48 \pm 0.02$ Mpc, located at a projected distance of 0.95 Mpc from the cluster centre. XMM-Newton X-ray data show that the relic's position and orientation relative to the intracluster medium (ICM) elongation are consistent with a merger-driven shock-wave scenario. The relic has an estimated radio power of $3.10 \pm 0.03 \times 10^{24}$ W Hz$^{-1}$ at 150 MHz. When placed in the $P_{150\,\mathrm{MHz}}$--$M_{500}$ scaling relation, the Abell 4067 relic appears less luminous compared to relics in more massive clusters, suggesting an association with weak merger shocks. This finding supports the idea that relics in low-mass clusters may form through less energetic merger events, leading to weak merger shocks. This is further supported by the absence of a detectable central radio halo in Abell 4067, reinforcing the idea that luminous radio halos are not a universal outcome of cluster mergers and highlighting the role of cluster mass, merger energetics, and evolutionary stage in shaping diffuse radio emission in the intracluster medium. | [🔗 Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.24206v1) |
| [MT-PingEval: Evaluating Multi-Turn Collaboration with Private Information Games](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.24188v1) | Jacob Eisenstein, Fantine Huot, Adam Fisch, Jonathan Berant, Mirella Lapata | 2026-02-27 | Scaling Laws | We present a scalable methodology for evaluating language models in multi-turn interactions, using a suite of collaborative games that require effective communication about private information. This enables an interactive scaling analysis, in which a fixed token budget is divided over a variable number of turns. We find that in many cases, language models are unable to use interactive collaboration to improve over the non-interactive baseline scenario in which one agent attempts to summarize its information and the other agent immediately acts -- despite substantial headroom. This suggests that state-of-the-art models still suffer from significant weaknesses in planning and executing multi-turn collaborative conversations. We analyze the linguistic features of these dialogues, assessing the roles of sycophancy, information density, and discourse coherence. While there is no single linguistic explanation for the collaborative weaknesses of contemporary language models, we note that humans achieve comparable task success at superior token efficiency by producing dialogues that are more coherent than those produced by most language models. The proactive management of private information is a defining feature of real-world communication, and we hope that MT-PingEval will drive further work towards improving this capability. | [🔗 Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.24188v1) |

| [Enhancing Spatial Understanding in Image Generation via Reward Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.24233v1) | Zhenyu Tang, Chaoran Feng, Yufan Deng, Jie Wu, Xiaojie Li, Rui Wang, Yunpeng Chen, Daquan Zhou | 2026-02-27 | Training & Evaluation, RLHF, Diffusion Models | Recent progress in text-to-image generation has greatly advanced visual fidelity and creativity, but it has also imposed higher demands on prompt complexity-particularly in encoding intricate spatial relationships. In such cases, achieving satisfactory results often requires multiple sampling attempts. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel method that strengthens the spatial understanding of current image generation models. We first construct the SpatialReward-Dataset with over 80k preference pairs. Building on this dataset, we build SpatialScore, a reward model designed to evaluate the accuracy of spatial relationships in text-to-image generation, achieving performance that even surpasses leading proprietary models on spatial evaluation. We further demonstrate that this reward model effectively enables online reinforcement learning for the complex spatial generation. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks show that our specialized reward model yields significant and consistent gains in spatial understanding for image generation. | [🔗 Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.24233v1) |
| [Better Learning-Augmented Spanning Tree Algorithms via Metric Forest Completion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.24232v1) | Nate Veldt, Thomas Stanley, Benjamin W. Priest, Trevor Steil, Keita Iwabuchi, T. S. Jayram, Grace J. Li, Geoffrey Sanders | 2026-02-27 | Training & Evaluation | We present improved learning-augmented algorithms for finding an approximate minimum spanning tree (MST) for points in an arbitrary metric space. Our work follows a recent framework called metric forest completion (MFC), where the learned input is a forest that must be given additional edges to form a full spanning tree. Veldt et al. (2025) showed that optimally completing the forest takes $Ω(n^2)$ time, but designed a 2.62-approximation for MFC with subquadratic complexity. The same method is a $(2γ+ 1)$-approximation for the original MST problem, where $γ\geq 1$ is a quality parameter for the initial forest. We introduce a generalized method that interpolates between this prior algorithm and an optimal $Ω(n^2)$-time MFC algorithm. Our approach considers only edges incident to a growing number of strategically chosen ``representative'' points. One corollary of our analysis is to improve the approximation factor of the previous algorithm from 2.62 for MFC and $(2γ+1)$ for metric MST to 2 and $2γ$ respectively. We prove this is tight for worst-case instances, but we still obtain better instance-specific approximations using our generalized method. We complement our theoretical results with a thorough experimental evaluation. | [🔗 Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.24232v1) |
| [Flow-Based Density Ratio Estimation for Intractable Distributions with Applications in Genomics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.24201v1) | Egor Antipov, Alessandro Palma, Lorenzo Consoli, Stephan Günnemann, Andrea Dittadi, Fabian J. Theis | 2026-02-27 | Training & Evaluation | Estimating density ratios between pairs of intractable data distributions is a core problem in probabilistic modeling, enabling principled comparisons of sample likelihoods under different data-generating processes across conditions and covariates. While exact-likelihood models such as normalizing flows offer a promising approach to density ratio estimation, naive flow-based evaluations are computationally expensive, as they require simulating costly likelihood integrals for each distribution separately. In this work, we leverage condition-aware flow matching to derive a single dynamical formulation for tracking density ratios along generative trajectories. We demonstrate competitive performance on simulated benchmarks for closed-form ratio estimation, and show that our method supports versatile tasks in single-cell genomics data analysis, where likelihood-based comparisons of cellular states across experimental conditions enable treatment effect estimation and batch correction evaluation. | [🔗 Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.24201v1) |

| [Comparing Classical and Quantum Variational Classifiers on the XOR Problem](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.24220v1) | Miras Seilkhan, Adilbek Taizhanov | 2026-02-27 | Model Evaluation, Responsible AI, Optimization | Quantum machine learning applies principles such as superposition and entanglement to data processing and optimization. Variational quantum models operate on qubits in high-dimensional Hilbert spaces and provide an alternative approach to model expressivity. We compare classical models and a variational quantum classifier on the XOR problem. Logistic regression, a one-hidden-layer multilayer perceptron, and a two-qubit variational quantum classifier with circuit depths 1 and 2 are evaluated on synthetic XOR datasets with varying Gaussian noise and sample sizes using accuracy and binary cross-entropy.   Performance is determined primarily by model expressivity. Logistic regression and the depth-1 quantum circuit fail to represent XOR reliably, whereas the multilayer perceptron and the depth-2 quantum circuit achieve perfect test accuracy under representative conditions. Robustness analyses across noise levels, dataset sizes, and random seeds confirm that circuit depth is decisive for quantum performance on this task. Despite matching accuracy, the multilayer perceptron achieves lower binary cross-entropy and substantially shorter training time. Hardware execution preserves the global XOR structure but introduces structured deviations in the decision function. Overall, deeper variational quantum classifiers can match classical neural networks in accuracy on low-dimensional XOR benchmarks, but no clear empirical advantage in robustness or efficiency is observed in the examined settings. | [🔗 Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.24220v1) |
| [How IMU Drift Influences Multi-Radar Inertial Odometry for Ground Robots in Subterranean Terrains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.24192v1) | Moumita Mukherjee, Magnus Norén, Anton Koval, Avijit Banerjee, George Nikolakopoulos | 2026-02-27 | Model Evaluation, Responsible AI | Reliable radar inertial odometry (RIO) requires mitigating IMU bias drift, a challenge that intensifies in subterranean environments due to extreme temperatures and gravity-induced accelerations. Cost-effective IMUs such as the Pixhawk, when paired with FMCW TI IWR6843AOP EVM radars, suffer from drift-induced degradation compounded by sparse, noisy, and flickering radar returns, making fusion less stable than LiDAR-based odometry. Yet, LiDAR fails under smoke, dust, and aerosols, whereas FMCW radars remain compact, lightweight, cost-effective, and robust in these situations. To address these challenges, we propose a two-stage MRIO framework that combines an IMU bias estimator for resilient localization and mapping in GPS-denied subterranean environments affected by smoke. Radar-based ego-velocity estimation is formulated through a least-squares approach and incorporated into an EKF for online IMU bias correction; the corrected IMU accelerations are fused with heterogeneous measurements from multiple radars and an IMU to refine odometry. The proposed framework further supports radar-only mapping by exploiting the robot's estimated translational and rotational displacements. In subterranean field trials, MRIO delivers robust localization and mapping, outperforming EKF-RIO. It maintains accuracy across cost-efficient FMCW radar setups and different IMUs, showing resilience with Pixhawk and higher-grade units such as VectorNav. The implementation will be provided as an open-source resource to the community (code available at https://github.com/LTU-RAI/MRIO | [🔗 Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.24192v1) |

| [BLISSNet: Deep Operator Learning for Fast and Accurate Flow Reconstruction from Sparse Sensor Measurements](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.24228v1) | Maksym Veremchuk, K. Andrea Scott, Zhao Pan | 2026-02-27 | Prompt Engineering | Reconstructing fluid flows from sparse sensor measurements is a fundamental challenge in science and engineering. Widely separated measurements and complex, multiscale dynamics make accurate recovery of fine-scale structures difficult. In addition, existing methods face a persistent tradeoff: high-accuracy models are often computationally expensive, whereas faster approaches typically compromise fidelity. In this work, we introduce BLISSNet, a model that strikes a strong balance between reconstruction accuracy and computational efficiency for both flow reconstruction and nudging-based data assimilation. The model follows a DeepONet-like architecture, enabling zero-shot inference on domains of arbitrary size. After the first model call on a given domain, certain network components can be precomputed, leading to low inference cost for subsequent evaluations on large domains. Consequently, the model can achieve faster inference than classical interpolation methods such as radial basis function or bicubic interpolation. This combination of high accuracy, low cost, and zero-shot generalization makes BLISSNet well-suited for large-scale real-time flow reconstruction and data assimilation tasks. | [🔗 Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.24228v1) |

| [An Efficient Unsupervised Federated Learning Approach for Anomaly Detection in Heterogeneous IoT Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.24209v1) | Mohsen Tajgardan, Atena Shiranzaei, Mahdi Rabbani, Reza Khoshkangini, Mahtab Jamali | 2026-02-27 | AI Safety, Optimization | Federated learning (FL) is an effective paradigm for distributed environments such as the Internet of Things (IoT), where data from diverse devices with varying functionalities remains localized while contributing to a shared global model. By eliminating the need to transmit raw data, FL inherently preserves privacy. However, the heterogeneous nature of IoT data, stemming from differences in device capabilities, data formats, and communication constraints, poses significant challenges to maintaining both global model performance and privacy. In the context of IoT-based anomaly detection, unsupervised FL offers a promising means to identify abnormal behavior without centralized data aggregation. Nevertheless, feature heterogeneity across devices complicates model training and optimization, hindering effective implementation. In this study we propose an efficient unsupervised FL framework that enhances anomaly detection by leveraging shared features from two distinct IoT datasets: one focused on anomaly detection and the other on device identification, while preserving dataset-specific features. To improve transparency and interpretability, we employ explainable AI techniques, such as SHAP, to identify key features influencing local model decisions. Experiments conducted on real-world IoT datasets demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms conventional FL approaches in anomaly detection accuracy. This work underscores the potential of using shared features from complementary datasets to optimize unsupervised federated learning and achieve superior anomaly detection results in decentralized IoT environments. | [🔗 Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.24209v1) |

Moon | 2026-02-27 | Graph AI | Graphs are essential for modeling complex relationships and capturing structured interactions in data. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are particularly effective when such relational structure is explicitly available, but many real-world datasets, most notably tabular data, lack an inherent graph representation. To address this limitation, we propose RF-GNN, a framework that constructs instance-level graphs from tabular data using proximity measures induced by random forests. These proximities capture nonlinear feature interactions and data-adaptive similarity without imposing restrictive assumptions on feature geometry. The resulting graphs enable the direct application of GNNs to tabular learning problems. Extensive experiments on 36 benchmark datasets demonstrate that RF-GNN consistently outperforms strong classical baselines and recent graph-construction methods in terms of weighted F1-score. Additional ablation studies highlight the impact of proximity design choices and graph construction settings. | [🔗 Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.24224v1) |

However, their reasoning traces are difficult to control, which can result in the unintended leakage of private information to external parties. We propose training models to follow instructions not only in the final answer, but also in reasoning traces, potentially under different constraints. We hypothesize that improving their instruction following abilities in the reasoning traces can improve their privacy-preservation skills. To demonstrate this, we fine-tune models on a new instruction-following dataset with explicit restrictions on reasoning traces. We further introduce a generation strategy that decouples reasoning and answer generation using separate LoRA adapters. We evaluate our approach on six models from two model families, ranging from 1.7B to 14B parameters, across two instruction-following benchmarks and two privacy benchmarks. Our method yields substantial improvements, achieving gains of up to 20.9 points in instruction-following performance and up to 51.9 percentage points on privacy benchmarks. These improvements, however, can come at the cost of task utility, due to the trade-off between reasoning performance and instruction-following abilities. Overall, our results show that improving instruction-following behavior in reasoning models can significantly enhance privacy, suggesting a promising direction for the development of future privacy-aware agents.

| [nvidia-pcm: A D-Bus-Driven Platform Configuration Manager for OpenBMC Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.24237v1) | Harinder Singh | 2026-02-27 | General AI | GPU-accelerated server platforms that share most of their hardware architecture often require separate firmware images due to minor hardware differences--different component identifiers, thermal profiles, or interconnect topologies. I built nvidia-pcm to eliminate that overhead. nvidia-pcm is a platform configuration manager for NVBMC, NVIDIA's OpenBMC-based firmware distribution, that enables a single firmware image to serve multiple platform variants. At boot, nvidia-pcm queries hardware identity data over D-Bus and exports the correct platform-specific configuration as environment variables. Downstream services read those variables without knowing or caring which hardware variant they are running on. The result is that platform differences are captured entirely in declarative JSON files, not in separate build artifacts. This paper describes the architecture, implementation, and deployment impact of nvidia-pcm, and shares lessons learned from solving the platform-identity problem at a deliberately minimal level of abstraction--prioritizing adoption simplicity over comprehensive hardware modeling. | [🔗 Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.24237v1) |

Using benchmark X2C complete active space self-consistent-field (CASSCF) calculations for zero-field splittings in chalcogen diatomics, the contributions of two-electron spin-orbit coupling, electron spin-spin coupling, and quantum electrodynamics are carefully analyzed. The capability of the new Cholesky decomposition-based implementation for relativistic two-component CASSCF method using super-configuration-interaction algorithms is further demonstrated with calculations for the low-lying electronic states of neodymium aqua-ions with up to the second coordination shells. | [🔗 Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.24236v1) |
| [Stability of relaxed calibration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.24234v1) | Nicholas T. Longford | 2026-02-27 | General AI | Estimation of the population total of a variable can be improved by calibration on a set of auxiliary variables. It is difficult to establish that such a set of variables is sufficient, that estimation could not be improved by calibration on any further variables. We address this issue by finding an upper bound for the change of the calibration estimate of the population total of a variable when the auxiliary information is supplemented by another variable for which the population total is known. This upper bound can be interpreted as a measure of sensitivity of the estimate to unavailable auxiliary information and considered as a factor in deciding whether to seek further data sources that would be included in calibration. | [🔗 Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.24234v1) |

While minimizing regret requires repeated exploitation of high-reward arms, accurate inference on reward gaps requires sufficient exploration of suboptimal actions. We formalize this trade-off through the concept of Pareto optimality and establish equivalent conditions for Pareto-efficient learning in CMAB. We consider two relevant cases under different information structures, i.e., full-bandit feedback and semi-bandit feedback, and propose two algorithms MixCombKL and MixCombUCB respectively for these two cases. We provide theoretical guarantees showing that both algorithms are Pareto optimal, achieving finite-time guarantees on both regret and estimation error of arm gaps. Our results further reveal that richer feedback significantly tightens the attainable Pareto frontier, with the primary gains arising from improved estimation accuracy under our proposed methods. Taken together, these findings establish a principled framework for adaptive combinatorial experimentation in multi-objective decision-making. | [🔗 Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.24231v1) |
| [A Variational Estimator for $L_p$ Calibration Errors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.24230v1) | Eugène Berta, Sacha Braun, David Holzmüller, Francis Bach, Michael I. Jordan | 2026-02-27 | General AI | Calibration$\unicode{x2014}$the problem of ensuring that predicted probabilities align with observed class frequencies$\unicode{x2014}$is a basic desideratum for reliable prediction with machine learning systems. Calibration error is traditionally assessed via a divergence function, using the expected divergence between predictions and empirical frequencies. Accurately estimating this quantity is challenging, especially in the multiclass setting. Here, we show how to extend a recent variational framework for estimating calibration errors beyond divergences induced induced by proper losses, to cover a broad class of calibration errors induced by $L_p$ divergences. Our method can separate over- and under-confidence and, unlike non-variational approaches, avoids overestimation. We provide extensive experiments and integrate our code in the open-source package probmetrics (https://github.com/dholzmueller/probmetrics) for evaluating calibration errors. | [🔗 Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.24230v1) |
| [Imprints of $U_A(1)$ chiral anomaly and disorder in the Dirac eigenspectrum of QCD at finite temperature](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.24227v1) | Ravi Shanker, Harshit Pandey, Sayantan Sharma | 2026-02-27 | General AI | We perform a comprehensive study of the properties of Dirac eigenvalue spectrum in QCD as a function of temperature on the lattice. In addition to effects due to interplay between interactions and disorder inherently present in a many-body system, the Dirac spectrum also contains crucial information about the effective restoration of different subgroups of almost exact two flavor chiral symmetry in QCD. We calculate the infrared eigenvalues of the overlap Dirac operator on 2+1 flavor QCD ensembles generated using domain wall fermion discretization, on a large volume lattice. From the normalized level spacing ratios we identify those eigenvalues which have intermediate level statistics, distinctly different from the majority in the bulk spectrum that follow universal level fluctuations similar to a random matrix of Gaussian unitary type. We provide an explanation of these intermediate level ratios in terms of a specific random matrix model and quantify correlation between these eigenstates and disorder in the gauge fields manifested in the renormalized Polyakov loop values. Whereas existence of these intermediate eigenmodes are intimately connected to the effective restoration of different subgroups of chiral symmetry close to chiral crossover transition, these arise due to effects of random uncorrelated disorder at higher temperatures when the $U_A(1)$ is effectively restored. We also, for the first time, calculate the Thouless conductance for the Dirac spectrum that quantifies the structural rigidity of the eigenvectors, and use it as a diagnostic tool to understand the restoration of the anomalous $U_A(1)$ subgroup of chiral symmetry and localization driven due to disorder. | [🔗 Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.24227v1) |
| [Weighted Unequal Error Protection over a Rayleigh Fading Channel](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.24225v1) | Adeel Mahmood | 2026-02-27 | General AI | We study a variant of unequal error protection in channel coding, where the message bit string is divided into a finite number of blocks and the maximization objective is a weighted sum of per-block decoding success probabilities. The channel model is quasi-static Rayleigh fading with channel state information available to the receiver but unavailable to the transmitter. We analyze the asymptotic and finite blocklength performance of two achievability schemes, one based on power-domain superposition (PDS) and another based on orthogonal resource allocation (ORA), also known as time-sharing. Upper bounds on the optimal number of blocks to transmit are derived. Algorithms to compute the optimal power and time splits for the two schemes are given. Simplified algorithms to compute locally optimal power and time splits are also given, and their outputs match those of the previous algorithms across all tested parameters. Our results show that PDS outperforms ORA, but the performance differential is less than 2% in both the asymptotic and finite blocklength regimes (Figures 4 - 6). For both PDS and ORA, numerical results also upper bound the gap between the asymptotic and finite blocklength performance by approximately 10% for n = 1000 and 3% for n = 5000 (Figures 7 - 10). | [🔗 Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.24225v1) |

In this paper, we present Anansi, the first scalable, end-to-end measurement pipeline designed to systematically engage with, analyze, and characterize job scams in the wild. Anansi combines large language models (LLMs), automated browser agents, and infrastructure fingerprinting tools to collect over 29,000 scam messages, interact with more than 1900 scammers, and extract behavioral, financial, and infrastructural signals at scale. We detail the operational workflows of scammers, uncover extensive reuse of message templates, domains, and cryptocurrency wallets, and identify the social engineering tactics used to defraud victims. Our analysis reveals millions of dollars in cryptocurrency losses, highlighting the use of deceptive techniques such as domain fronting and impersonation of well-known brands. Anansi demonstrates the feasibility and value of automating the engagement with scammers and the analysis of infrastructure, offering a new methodological foundation for studying large-scale fraud ecosystems. | [🔗 Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.24223v1) |

Mailybaev, Luca Moriconi | 2026-02-27 | General AI | We present a renormalization-group perspective on spontaneous stochasticity in hydrodynamic turbulence, viewed through the lens of multiscale dynamical systems. Building on previously established results for a solvable multiscale Arnold's cat model, we show that spontaneous stochasticity emerges as a universal fixed point of an RG transformation acting on Markov kernels, independent of the microscopic regularization. Classical examples - including the Feigenbaum equation, the central limit theorem, and hierarchical spin models - are reinterpreted within the same framework, placing spontaneous stochasticity alongside other universality phenomena. | [🔗 Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.24221v1) |

G. Guarcello, T. Shenar, C. Evans, R. Prinja, D. Fenech | 2026-02-27 | General AI | Being the most massive known young stellar cluster in the Milky Way, Westerlund 1 (Wd1) constitutes an ideal benchmark for understanding the evolution of massive stars. However, the cluster age remains highly controversial (~4-10 Myr), hindering the use of Wd1 as a reference for massive star evolution. One of the main issues is high foreground extinction, which has so far prevented the detection of the main sequence. Using infrared spectroscopy we seek to detect the cluster's main sequence for the first time, to characterise the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, and to use the cluster's turn-off to obtain a robust age estimate. We obtained multi-epoch, near-infrared VLT/KMOS spectroscopic observations of Wd1 to map its population of massive stars. The spectra of ~110 members were analysed with CMFGEN models to derive stellar parameters, populate the cluster Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, and compare it with isochrones from evolutionary models. Our observations returned 47 new spectroscopically identified cluster members, with spectral types O9-B1 III-V. The cluster turn-off indicates an age of 5.5+/-1.0 Myr at a distance of 4.23+0.23-0.21 kpc, displaying a moderate degree of coevality. We demonstrate that our estimate of the age of Wd1 is robust against reasonable changes in the distance and extinction law, and the adopted rotational velocity and metallicity of the stellar isochrones. We further find that ~65% of the OB stars with multi-epoch coverage exhibit radial-velocity variability. Infrared observations of the unevolved stellar population support a single episode of star formation with an age of ~5.5 Myr, reinforcing its potential as a benchmark for massive star evolution and providing a reference sample for future binary population studies. | [🔗 Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.24218v1) |

Continuum fitting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.24217v1) | Laetitia Gibaud, Marek Nikołajuk, Piotr Życki, Agata Różańska, Krzysztof Hryniewicz, Rafał Wojaczyński | 2026-02-27 | General AI | We present a broadband study of the WLQ SDSS J101353.45+492758.1, which displays a nearly featureless UV-optical spectrum with only a weak Mg II line alongside an exceptionally low X-ray flux. We model its spectral energy distribution using the relativistic thin-disk model kerrbb with a power law, and the multicomponent AGN model relagn, a physically motivated extension of agnsed incorporating warm and hot Comptonizing regions. Our fits constrain the black hole mass, accretion rate, X-ray loudness, and coronal energetics. Both approaches yield consistent BH masses of M_{BH} \approx 2 \times 10^{9} M_\odot and an Eddington accretion rate of \dot m \approx 0.1. The relagn fit including a warm Comptonizing region provides a significantly improved representation of the UV-soft X-ray continuum. The warm corona, characterized by kTe \simeq 0.20 keV, Γ \simeq 3.8, and an optical depth τ \simeq 7.26, extends to \sim 34 R_g. The hot corona appears compact and energetically suppressed, leading to an intrinsically weak X ray output with log(L_{X}/L_{bol}) \simeq -4.29, among the lowest reported for WLQs. The α_{ox} \sim 2.06 indicates the source to be in high/soft AGN spectral state. The combination of a luminous, standard disk and extremely weak hot corona suggests that this quasar hosts a highly inefficient inner coronal region. This explains its X-ray faintness and extreme deficit of high-ionization emission lines. The source may represent an AGN analog in "ultrasoft" accretion state, or a system in which the ionizing continuum is suppressed by a compact or quenched corona. Our study suggests that the source is not accreting at high Eddington ratio, highlighting the physical diversity of WLQs, and supports the view that geometric and radiative effects jointly shape their extreme spectral properties. | [🔗 Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.24217v1) |
| [Two-zero textures of the Majorana neutrino mass matrix from $\mathbb{Z}_3$ gauging of $\mathbb{Z}_N$ non-invertible symmetry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.24214v1) | Bu-Yao Qu, Zheng Jiang, Gui-Jun Ding | 2026-02-27 | General AI | Texture-zero ansatze offer an economical description of neutrino masses, with current data allowing only seven inequivalent two-zero Majorana textures in the charged-lepton mass basis. We investigate how such textures can arise from non-invertible symmetries realized through $\mathbb{Z}_3$ gauging of $\mathbb{Z}_N$. In contrast to $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauging, which necessarily induces diagonal neutrino mass terms via the Weinberg operator, $\mathbb{Z}_3$ gauging admits complex representations and allows a richer class of neutrino mass textures. If the light neutrino mass is described by the Weinberg operator, we find that the textures $\mathbf{A}_{1,2}$, $\mathbf{B}_{3,4}$, and $\mathbf{C}$ can be realized from the $\mathbb{Z}_{3}$ gauging of $\mathbb{Z}_{13}$ symmetry, while all the seven phenomenologically viable two-zero textures can emerge from $\mathbb{Z}_{3}$ gauging of $\mathbb{Z}_{19}$ symmetry without requiring supersymmetry. When the neutrino mass is generated by the type-I seesaw mechanism, the structure of the non-invertible symmetry is more restrictive, yielding only texture $\mathbf{C}$ for $N\neq7$. These results demonstrate the strong predictive power of non-invertible symmetries for neutrino mass textures. Furthermore, the more general $\mathbb{Z}_{n}$ gauging of the $\mathbb{Z}_{N}$ symmetry with $n>3$ is analyzed, which results in novel fusion rules. | [🔗 Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.24214v1) |

Ghioldi, Long Chen, Alexander I. Kolesnikov, Haidong Zhou, Shang-Shun Zhang, Cristian D. Batista, Martin Mourigal | 2026-02-27 | General AI | Strong quantum fluctuations and unconventional spin dynamics are well established in the spin-1/2 triangular lattice Heisenberg antiferromagnet. However, their survival in the spin-1 case remains an open question. We investigate the spin dynamics of K$_2$Ni(SeO$_3$)$_2$, a nearly ideal spin-1 triangular lattice Heisenberg antiferromagnet, using inelastic neutron scattering. Below the ordering temperature $T_{\rm N}$, we observe coherent one-magnon excitations coexisting with a broad high-energy continuum. Two complementary approaches, a spectrally consistent $1/S$-corrected spin wave theory and a beyond-mean-field Schwinger boson theory, reproduce different facets of the continuum. Neither alone is complete, demonstrating substantial quantum fluctuations survive for $S\!=\!1$ and are reflected primarily in the spectral distribution of the continuum. Above $T_{\rm N}$, the continuum bandwidth is conserved while spectral weight is redistributed as magnons lose spatial coherence. Our results establish K$_2$Ni(SeO$_3$)$_2$ as a model triangular antiferromagnet, identifying bandwidth conservation and the distribution of spectral weight within the continuum as organizing principles to understand the spin dynamics of ordered quantum magnets beyond spin-1/2. Our results highlight the need for controlled calculations of the interacting multi-magnon sector of 2D antiferromagnets. | [🔗 Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.24212v1) |

Cisneros, Rich Ott, Meagan Crowley, Amy Roberts, Marcus Paz | 2026-02-27 | General AI | One key piece of evidence for dark matter is the rotation-curve problem: the disagreement between measured galactic rotation curves and their luminous mass. A novel solution to this problem is presented here, in a model that predicts observed Doppler-shifted spectra based only on the luminous matter estimates and one free model parameter. This model is applied to fit the rotation curves of the SPARC sample of 175 galaxies, yielding mass-to-light ratios, goodness of fit measurements, and the free parameter. The model's average reduced chi square compares favorably with the dark matter model for the same data, and more galaxies are successfully fit by this model. The model provides a useful formulation linking luminous matter to the observed rotation curves, with the dark matter contribution to galaxies encoded in two transformation terms of the luminous mass. It also offers a lower-parameter characterization of the rotation curve problem, and a power law relationship between the model's free parameter and galactic photometric quantities is observed, potentially removing the need for the free parameter. | [🔗 Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.24211v1) |
| [Duality of Theoretical Approaches to Understand the Electrical Double Layer in Concentrated Electrolytes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.24205v1) | Zachary A. H. Goodwin | 2026-02-27 | General AI | Understanding the electrical double layer (EDL), i.e, the distribution of electrolyte at an electrified interface, in concentrated electrolytes is important for various technologies, such as supercapacitors, batteries and electrocatalysis. Atomistic approaches offer unprecedented detail, but are too computationally expensive to exhaustively investigate the EDL of concentrated electrolytes, motivating the development of continuum theories. In these concentrated electrolytes, correlations between ions and solvents are strong, through electrostatic and specific interactions, as well as significant excluded volume effects of the complicated molecular species, making the development of theories challenging. Thus far, there are mainly two distinct \textit{simple} theoretical approaches to understand the EDL of concentrated electrolytes, with account of these correlations beyond mean-field. One is a local-density approximation (LDA) based on treating electrostatic and specific interactions beyond mean-field through the ionic aggregation and solvation; where a simple conceptual understanding can be gained and reasonable agreement with experiments in terms of integrated quantities, but poor agreement for ion profiles and Debye capacitance. The other approach is to treat electrostatic correlations and excluded volume effects more rigorously with beyond LDA approaches, but at the cost of simplifying the chemical interactions between species; where excellent agreement can be obtained for ion profiles, differential capacitance, etc., but mainly for the simplified hard-sphere systems that the theories are based on. Here, we describe the merits and downfalls of these two approaches, how they have contributed to understanding anomalous underscreening, and outline future directions for these theoretical approaches. | [🔗 Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.24205v1) |

Zebrowski | 2026-02-27 | General AI | We forecast that the Terahertz Intensity Mapper (TIM) cross-correlated with Euclid's Fornax deep field (EDF-F), TIM$\times$EDF-F, will detect the [CII]-galaxy cross-power spectrum at a median redshift of 1.1 with $\gtrsim 7 σ$ confidence. The Poisson component of the cross-power spectrum at $0.1 \leq k \leq 10$ hMpc$^{-1}$ (i.e. cross-shot noise) will be detected at $\gtrsim 3 σ$ in 4 bins spanning $0.5 < z< 1.7$. This measurement will constrain the mean [CII] specific intensity over half of cosmic history and assess the degree to which Euclid-selected galaxies account for the [CII] intensity observed by TIM. We find that TIM can detect the cross-power spectrum across a wide range of [CII] intensity models. | [🔗 Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.24204v1) |

Laudenslager, Antonio Alvarez Valdivia, Nathaniel Hanson, Margaret McGuinness | 2026-02-27 | General AI | Soft, tip-extending vine robots are well suited for navigating tight, debris-filled environments, making them ideal for urban search and rescue. Sensing the full shape of a vine robot's body is helpful both for localizing information from other sensors placed along the robot body and for determining the robot's configuration within the space being explored. Prior approaches have localized vine robot tips using a single inertial measurement unit (IMU) combined with force sensing or length estimation, while one method demonstrated full-body shape sensing using distributed IMUs on a passively steered robot in controlled maze environments. However, the accuracy of distributed IMU-based shape sensing under active steering, varying robot lengths, and different sensor spacings has not been systematically quantified. In this work, we experimentally evaluate the accuracy of vine robot shape sensing using distributed IMUs along the robot body. We quantify IMU drift, measuring an average orientation drift rate of 1.33 degrees/min across 15 sensors. For passive steering, mean tip position error was 11% of robot length. For active steering, mean tip position error increased to 16%. During growth experiments across lengths from 30-175 cm, mean tip error was 8%, with a positive trend with increasing length. We also analyze the influence of sensor spacing and observe that intermediate spacings can minimize error for single-curvature shapes. These results demonstrate the feasibility of distributed IMU-based shape sensing for vine robots while highlighting key limitations and opportunities for improved modeling and algorithmic integration for field deployment. | [🔗 Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.24202v1) |

Although the concept promises measurement ranges of many orders of magnitude, its practical implementation is limited by the lack of light sources that allow fast, reliable, and calibration-free switching between synthetic wavelengths over a wide frequency range. Here, we present a synthetic-wavelength generator based on an electro-optic frequency comb with electronically tunable modulation frequency and a set of switchable band-pass filters. By combining discrete selection of comb-lines with continuous radio-frequency tuning, the proposed scheme merges the advantages of single-sideband modulation and filter-based comb extraction. Using only off-the-shelf components, the system provides synthetic frequencies from 0.1-220GHz, corresponding to synthetic wavelengths from meters down to millimeters in the visible. The generator achieves MHz-level frequency accuracy, side-mode suppression exceeding 40dB, and switching times below 25ms, even without active stabilization. We characterize the spectral purity and frequency agility of the source and demonstrate rapid tuning of synthetic wavelengths over 3 orders of magnitude. We apply the light source to multi-wavelength digital holography and reconstruct the surface of an industrially machined metal part featuring height variations from 0.1-100mm. The measurements achieve ten-mum-level precision using 7 single wavelengths covering synthetic wavelengths from 1.36mm to 1.874m within an acquisition time < 2s. The presented architecture combines high dynamic measurement range of 50dB, fast electronic reconfigurability, and intrinsic frequency calibration, making it a promising light source for high-speed interferometric surface metrology. | [🔗 Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.24199v1) |

Varlamov, Francesco Giazotto, Jeroen van den Brink, Mario Cuoco | 2026-02-27 | General AI | Superconducting diodes that support nonreciprocal supercurrent flow in principle constitute attractive, non-dissipative, circuit elements for superconducting electronics. But their realization faces fundamental challenges, as conventional Josephson tunnel junctions are inherently reciprocal. Existing approaches to break reciprocity typically involve magnetism or spin-orbit coupling, which often increase device complexity and limit reproducibility. Here, we demonstrate an alternative dynamical route to supercurrent nonreciprocity based on parametric driving. By applying a frequency-modulated supercurrent amplitude we show that effective higher-order, nonharmonic terms are generated in the current-phase relation. Leveraging mathematical equivalences with the Kapitza pendulum, we show that these terms dynamically break reciprocity. This establishes the concept of a Kapitza supercurrent diode and demonstrates that nonreciprocal superconducting transport can be engineered by nonequilibrium driving conventional Josephson tunnel junctions. We propose two implementations of the Kapitza supercurrent diode - via gate-controlled superconducting interferometers or flux-driven double-loop SQUIDs - to achieve nonreciprocal supercurrent transport within experimentally accessible frequencies $ω/2π\sim 1$-$10\,\mathrm{GHz}$. | [🔗 Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.24198v1) |

However, a systematic framework for comparing their predictive capabilities and identifying their respective validity limits remains largely unexplored. In this work, we introduce a comparative methodology in which four representative methods - including rigorous numerical and effective-index-based approaches - are analyzed and partially hybridized within a coupled-wave-theory framework. Using single-lattice and double-lattice PCSELs as representative models, we demonstrate that this approach not only reveals fundamental differences between predictions of rigorous numerical methods and the coupled-wave-theory framework, but also captures a qualitative phase transition and a symmetry-broken phase of quasi-bound states in the continuum (quasi-BICs) relevant for laser operation. | [🔗 Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.24197v1) |

Nofi | 2026-02-27 | General AI | Using the POLISH2 polarimeter at the Lick Observatory Shane 3-m and Nickel 1-m telescopes, we discover rotation phase-locked variations in linear polarization to be common among asteroids and a NEO in a clear, 383 to 720 nm bandpass. Essentially all bodies in our eight-year study harbor statistically significant, repeatable linear polarization variations at the $0.01\% = 100$ ppm level or above (1 Ceres, 2 Pallas, 3 Juno, 4 Vesta, 6 Hebe, 7 Iris, 12 Victoria, 15 Eunomia, 16 Psyche, 132 Aethra, 216 Kleopatra, and 65803 Didymos). Since polarimetry is a differential technique, such variations cannot be due to shape changes and must be caused by heterogeneity in surface albedo and/or composition. While (4) Vesta has long been known to exhibit large, repeatable polarization variations across its surface, we discover the variations on (6) Hebe, (12) Victoria, and (65803) Didymos to be 1.5 to 3.5 times as large. We hypothesize that the \textit{DART} impact with Dimorphos blanketed Didymos with depolarizing ejecta, which suggests pristine variations across Didymos to have been even larger. As the only NEO in this study with data quality sufficient to investigate polarization variations, Didymos' huge variations suggest they may be common among NEOs. We also discover optical circular polarization to be enhanced for low-albedo, M type asteroids, which is correlated with their large radar albedos. Thus, we present optical circular polarimetry as an alternative method for the identification of metalliferous bodies. | [🔗 Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.24196v1) |
| [Betting under Common Beliefs: The Effect of Probability Weighting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.24194v1) | Patrick Beissner, Tim Boonen, Mario Ghossoub | 2026-02-27 | General AI | This paper examines the impact of introducing a Rank-Dependent Utility (RDU) agent into a von Neumann-Morgenstern (vNM) pure-exchange economy with no aggregate uncertainty. In the absence of the RDU agent, the classical theory predicts that Pareto-optimal allocations are full-insurance, or no-betting, allocations. We show how the probability weighting function of the RDU agent, seen as a proxy for probabilistic risk aversion that is not captured by marginal utility of wealth, can lead to Pareto optima characterized by endogenous betting, despite common baseline beliefs. Such endogenous betting at an optimum leads to uncertainty-generating trade arising purely from heterogeneity in the perception of risk, rather than in beliefs. Our results formalize the intuitive understanding that probability weighting can act as an endogenous source of belief heterogeneity, and provide a new behavioral foundation for the coexistence of common beliefs and speculative behavior, in an environment with no initial aggregate uncertainty. Interpreting the RDU agent's nonlinear weighting function as an ``internality'' prompts the question of whether a social planner should intervene. We show how a benevolent social planner can nudge the RDU agent to behave closer to a vNM agent, through costly statistical or financial education, thereby (partially) restoring the optimality of full-insurance allocations. | [🔗 Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.24194v1) |

Under the condition that $F_β(z)$ has no zeros in $D(0,r)$, the scaled zero counting measure converges to a limiting measure $μ_{0}^β$ vaguely in distribution. This limit exhibits a \emph{forbidden region} \[ \bigl\{1< z <e^{1/β}\bigr\}, \] which zeros asymptotically avoid. This generalizes the remarkable discovery of Ghosh and Nishry for the Gaussian entire function (the case $β=2$), who first revealed this striking conditional convergence and the emergence of a hole. Our analysis extends their phenomenon to the entire family of power-exponential weights. | [🔗 Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.24193v1) |
| [Resilient Strategies for Stochastic Systems: How Much Does It Take to Break a Winning Strategy?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.24191v1) | Kush Grover, Markel Zubia, Debraj Chakraborty, Muqsit Azeem, Nils Jansen, Jan Kretinsky | 2026-02-27 | General AI | We study the problem of resilient strategies in the presence of uncertainty. Resilient strategies enable an agent to make decisions that are robust against disturbances. In particular, we are interested in those disturbances that are able to flip a decision made by the agent. Such a disturbance may, for instance, occur when the intended action of the agent cannot be executed due to a malfunction of an actuator in the environment. In this work, we introduce the concept of resilience in the stochastic setting and present a comprehensive set of fundamental problems. Specifically, we discuss such problems for Markov decision processes with reachability and safety objectives, which also smoothly extend to stochastic games. To account for the stochastic setting, we provide various ways of aggregating the amounts of disturbances that may have occurred, for instance, in expectation or in the worst case. Moreover, to reason about infinite disturbances, we use quantitative measures, like their frequency of occurrence. | [🔗 Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.24191v1) |
| [The Light Quark Connected Hadronic Vacuum Polarization Contribution to the muon anomaly via Sparsened Meson Fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.24190v1) | Vaishakhi Moningi, Christopher Aubin, Thomas Blum, Maarten Golterman, Luchang Jin, Santiago Peris | 2026-02-27 | General AI | We present an update on our determination of the light-quark connected contribution to the hadronic vacuum polarization (HVP) of the muon anomalous magnetic moment, $a_μ$, on a finer lattice with 2+1+1 highly-improved staggered quark (HISQ) ensemble from the MILC collaboration with physical pion mass, 0.042 fm lattice spacing, and size $144^3 \times 288$ sites. Within the low-mode averaging (LMA) framework, the HVP correlator is decomposed into low-low (LL), high-low (HL), low-high (LH) and high-high (HH) components. Since the LL part dominates the total statistical uncertainty but is also the most computationally expensive to evaluate, we implement a sparsening strategy to construct the meson fields efficiently. This approach significantly reduces the computational cost while preserving signal quality. By combining the sparsened LL contribution with HL, LH and HH components, we achieve an improved determination of the light-quark connected HVP contribution to $a_μ$. | [🔗 Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.24190v1) |
| [Almost sure CLT for hyperbolic Anderson model with Lévy colored noise](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.24189v1) | Raluca M. Balan, Hanniel E. Kouamé, William D. Stephenson | 2026-02-27 | General AI | In this note, we prove the Almost Sure Central Limit Theorem (ASCLT) for the spatial integral of the solution of the hyperbolic Anderson model driven by the Lévy colored noise introduced in Balan (2015). For this, we use the central limit theorem for the normalized spatial integral, and an estimate for the Malliavin derivative of the solution, both derived in the recent preprint Balan and Stephenson (2026). We assume that the spatial correlation kernel of the noise is either integrable, or it is given by the Riesz kernel. | [🔗 Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.24189v1) |
| [Pion and $ρ$ meson's unpolarized quark distribution functions from $q\bar{q}$ and all Fock-states within Dyson--Schwinger equations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.24187v1) | Chao Shi, Liming Lu, Wenbao Jia | 2026-02-27 | General AI | We compute the twist-2 unpolarized quark parton distribution functions (PDFs) of the pion and the $ρ$ meson within the Dyson-Schwinger equations (DSEs) framework using the rainbow-ladder (RL) truncation. A new DSE for the spin-1 hadron's quark-quark correlation matrix is derived, from which the PDFs can be extracted. For the $ρ$ meson, we obtain for the first time within RL-DSEs the unpolarized PDFs corresponding to different helicity states. A pronounced difference is observed between the $ Λ =1$ and $Λ=0$ cases, where $Λ$ denotes the meson helicity, leading to a nonvanishing and numerically sizable tensor-polarized PDF $f_{1LL}(x)$. We further compare these results with those obtained under a leading Fock-state ($ q\bar{q}\rangle$) truncation and find substantial deviations. This comparison demonstrates that the present RL-DSEs framework incorporates higher Fock-state contributions associated with gluonic degrees of freedom, which has a significant impact on the quark distributions. | [🔗 Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.24187v1) |
| [Endpoint Estimates for Bergman Commutators and New Characterizations of the Bloch Space and $H^\infty$](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.24186v1) | Adam B. Christopherson, Zhenghui Huo, Nathan A. Wagner, Yunus E. Zeytuncu | 2026-02-27 | General AI | We prove an $\LlogL $-type distributional inequality for the commutator of the Bergman projection with a conjugate Bloch symbol function on the unit ball. Such an inequality can be seen as a Bergman version of a result due to C. Pérez for real-variable Calderón-Zygmund operators and BMO functions. We also prove that this inequality characterizes membership of analytic functions in the Bloch space and is further equivalent to a kind of modified restricted weak-type estimate, where one only tests over characteristic functions of sets comparable to Bergman balls. We also show our estimate is sharp in the sense that there exists a Bloch function $b$ so that the commutator $[\bar{b},P]$ is not weak-type $(1,1)$, and prove $[\bar{b},P]$ with $b$ analytic is weak-type $(1,1)$ if and only if $b \in H^\infty$. | [🔗 Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.24186v1) |
| [Few Made It Out: A Multi-Messenger Study of an In Situ Solar Energetic Electron Event Driven by a Solar Jet](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.24185v1) | Meiqi Wang, Bin Chen, Mallory Wickline, Sijie Yu, Sam Krucker, Jeongwoo Lee, Haimin Wang | 2026-02-27 | General AI | When in situ solar energetic electron (SEE) events are closely associated with nonthermal flares, the escaping electron population is frequently observed to be much smaller than the nonthermal-radiation-emitting population near the solar surface. If a single accelerated population drives both signatures, the physical mechanism causing this severe deficit of upward-propagating electrons remains poorly understood.Focusing on one of the 2022 November 10--12 SEE events associated with recurrent solar jets and interplanetary type III radio bursts, we present a new, combined microwave--X-ray analysis using the Expanded Owens Valley Solar Array (EOVSA) and the Spectrometer/Telescope for Imaging X-rays (STIX) aboard Solar Orbiter. This synergy enables, for the first time for such an event, spatially resolved diagnostics over a broad energy spectrum of the near-Sun energetic electrons, complemented by in situ measurements made by spacecraft at multiple heliocentric longitudes and distances. Consistent with earlier results based on in situ and X-ray data, our results show that only 0.1--1\% of energetic electrons escape into interplanetary space. Crucially, the new microwave spectral imaging analysis suggests that energetic electrons are strongly concentrated in a compact region just above a mini-flare arcade at the base of the jet spire, and that their number density decreases by at least two orders of magnitude in the direction of the jet spire away from this region. This steep gradient, revealed by the microwave diagnostics, points to efficient local acceleration and trapping in the region analogous to the above-the-looptop ``magnetic bottle'' region in major eruptive flares, allowing only a small fraction of electrons to access open magnetic field lines and enter interplanetary space. | [🔗 Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.24185v1) |
