| [Two ADI compact difference methods for variable-exponent diffusion wave
  equations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21316v1) | Hao Zhang, Kexin Li, Wenlin Qiu | 2025-09-25 | Diffusion Models | In this work, we study two-dimensional diffusion-wave equations with variable exponent, modeling mechanical diffusive wave propagation in viscoelastic media with spatially varying properties. We first transform the diffusion-wave model into an equivalent form via the convolution method. Two time discretization strategies are then applied to approximate each term in the transformed equation, yielding two fully discrete schemes based on a spatial compact finite difference method. To reduce computational cost, the alternating direction implicit (ADI) technique is employed. We prove that both ADI compact schemes are unconditionally stable and convergent. Under solution regularity, the first scheme achieves $\alpha(0)$-order accuracy in time and fourth-order accuracy in space, while the second scheme attains second-order accuracy in time and fourth-order accuracy in space. Numerical experiments confirm the theoretical error estimates and demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed methods. | [🔗 Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21316v1) |

| [SD3.5-Flash: Distribution-Guided Distillation of Generative Flows](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21318v1) | Hmrishav Bandyopadhyay, Rahim Entezari, Jim Scott, Reshinth Adithyan, Yi-Zhe Song, Varun Jampani | 2025-09-25 | Optimization, Training & Evaluation, Diffusion Models, RLHF | We present SD3.5-Flash, an efficient few-step distillation framework that brings high-quality image generation to accessible consumer devices. Our approach distills computationally prohibitive rectified flow models through a reformulated distribution matching objective tailored specifically for few-step generation. We introduce two key innovations: "timestep sharing" to reduce gradient noise and "split-timestep fine-tuning" to improve prompt alignment. Combined with comprehensive pipeline optimizations like text encoder restructuring and specialized quantization, our system enables both rapid generation and memory-efficient deployment across different hardware configurations. This democratizes access across the full spectrum of devices, from mobile phones to desktop computers. Through extensive evaluation including large-scale user studies, we demonstrate that SD3.5-Flash consistently outperforms existing few-step methods, making advanced generative AI truly accessible for practical deployment. | [🔗 Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21318v1) |
| [Interactive Recommendation Agent with Active User Commands](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21317v1) | Jiakai Tang, Yujie Luo, Xunke Xi, Fei Sun, Xueyang Feng, Sunhao Dai, Chao Yi, Dian Chen, Zhujin Gao, Yang Li, Xu Chen, Wen Chen, Jian Wu, Yuning Jiang, Bo Zheng | 2025-09-25 | Optimization | Traditional recommender systems rely on passive feedback mechanisms that limit users to simple choices such as like and dislike. However, these coarse-grained signals fail to capture users' nuanced behavior motivations and intentions. In turn, current systems cannot also distinguish which specific item attributes drive user satisfaction or dissatisfaction, resulting in inaccurate preference modeling. These fundamental limitations create a persistent gap between user intentions and system interpretations, ultimately undermining user satisfaction and harming system effectiveness.   To address these limitations, we introduce the Interactive Recommendation Feed (IRF), a pioneering paradigm that enables natural language commands within mainstream recommendation feeds. Unlike traditional systems that confine users to passive implicit behavioral influence, IRF empowers active explicit control over recommendation policies through real-time linguistic commands. To support this paradigm, we develop RecBot, a dual-agent architecture where a Parser Agent transforms linguistic expressions into structured preferences and a Planner Agent dynamically orchestrates adaptive tool chains for on-the-fly policy adjustment. To enable practical deployment, we employ simulation-augmented knowledge distillation to achieve efficient performance while maintaining strong reasoning capabilities. Through extensive offline and long-term online experiments, RecBot shows significant improvements in both user satisfaction and business outcomes. | [🔗 Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21317v1) |
| [Efficient Digital Methods to Quantify Sensor Output Uncertainty](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21311v1) | Orestis Kaparounakis, Phillip Stanley-Marbell | 2025-09-25 | Optimization | Accurate characterization of sensor output uncertainty is important for reliable data interpretation in many applications. Here, we investigate the impact of transducer-level measurement uncertainty on overall sensor measurement accuracy due to limited-precision information about sensor components. We explain our method using thermopile-based sensors as an example class of sensors. We show how sensor calibration and conversion equations, which are an essential part of all sensing systems, propagate uncertainties resulting from the quantization of calibration parameters, to the final, compensated sensor output. The experimental results show that the epistemic uncertainty of calibration-related quantities leads to absolute error in the sensor output as high as 5.3 {\deg}C (and relative error as high as 25.7%) for one commonly-used thermopile sensor. In one instance of using the epistemic uncertainty information in edge detection, we show reduction of false-positives edges to zero for the conventional Canny operator, while maintaining accuracy. We show these ideas are practical and possible on actual embedded sensor systems by prototyping them on two commercially-available uncertainty tracking hardware platforms, one with average power dissipation 16.7 mW and 42.9x speedup compared to the equal-confidence Monte Carlo computation (the status quo), and the other with average power dissipation 147.15 mW and 94.4x speedup, paving the way for use in real time. | [🔗 Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21311v1) |

| [Hysteresis Measurements as a Diagnostic Tool: A Systematic Approach for
  Stability Benchmarking and Performance Projection of 2D-Materials-Based
  MOSFETs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21315v1) | Alexander Karl, Dominic Waldhoer, Theresia Knobloch, Axel Verdianu, Joël Kurzweil, Mina Bahrami, Mohammad Rasool Davoudi, Pedram Khakbaz, Bernhard Stampfer, Seyed Mehdi Sattari-Esfahlan, Yury Illarionov, Aftab Nazir, Changze Liu, Saptarshi Das, Xiao Renshaw Wang, Junchuan Tang, Yichi Zhang, Congwei Tan, Ye Li, Hailin Peng, Michael Waltl, Tibor Grasser | 2025-09-25 | Training & Evaluation, Model Evaluation | Judging by its omnipresence in the literature, the hysteresis observed in the transfer characteristics of emerging transistors based on 2D-materials is widely accepted as an important metric related to the device quality. The hysteresis is often reported with attributes like "negligible" or "small" without giving any specifics as to how this was determined and against what reference the measured values were compared to. Quite surprisingly, there appears to be only a fragmentary understanding of the mechanisms actually contributing to hysteresis and the sensitivity of the actual measurement on various experimental parameters. We attempt to close this gap by first providing a comprehensive theoretical analysis of the dominant mechanisms contributing to hysteresis: charge trapping by defects from the channel or the gate, the drift of mobile charges, and eventually ferroelectricity. We continue by suggesting methods to experimentally distinguishing between these phenomena. Based on these discussions it becomes clear that previously reported hysteresis values have little meaning as they have been non-systematically recorded under arbitrary conditions. In order to resolve this predicament, we propose a standardized hysteresis measurement scheme to establish the hysteresis as a comparable metric for the assessment of device stability. Our standardized scheme ensures that hysteresis data can be effectively compared across different technologies and, most importantly, provide a means to extrapolate data obtained on thicker prototypes to subnanometer equivalent oxide thicknesses. This facilitates the systematic benchmarking of insulator/channel combinations in terms of stability, which thereby enables the screening of material systems for more stable and reliable 2D-material-based MOSFETs. | [🔗 Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21315v1) |

The model is pretrained on a 206B-token corpus spanning scientific text, pure sequences, and sequence-text pairs, then aligned via SFT on 40M instructions, annealed cold-start bootstrapping to elicit long-form chain-of-thought, and reinforcement learning with task-specific reward shaping, which instills deliberate scientific reasoning. It supports four capability families, covering up to 103 tasks across workflows: (i) faithful translation between text and scientific formats, (ii) text/knowledge extraction, (iii) property prediction, (iv) property classification, (v) unconditional and conditional sequence generation and design. Compared with specialist systems, our approach broadens instruction coverage, improves cross-domain generalization, and enhances fidelity. We detail data curation and training and show that cross-discipline learning strengthens transfer and downstream reliability. The model, instruct tuning datasets and the evaluation code are open-sourced at https://huggingface.co/SciReason and https://github.com/open-sciencelab/SciReason. | [🔗 Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21320v1) |

| [RLBFF: Binary Flexible Feedback to bridge between Human Feedback &
  Verifiable Rewards](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21319v1) | Zhilin Wang, Jiaqi Zeng, Olivier Delalleau, Ellie Evans, Daniel Egert, Hoo-Chang Shin, Felipe Soares, Yi Dong, Oleksii Kuchaiev | 2025-09-25 | AI Safety, Fine-Tuning, RLHF | Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) and Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) are the main RL paradigms used in LLM post-training, each offering distinct advantages. However, RLHF struggles with interpretability and reward hacking because it relies on human judgments that usually lack explicit criteria, whereas RLVR is limited in scope by its focus on correctness-based verifiers. We propose Reinforcement Learning with Binary Flexible Feedback (RLBFF), which combines the versatility of human-driven preferences with the precision of rule-based verification, enabling reward models to capture nuanced aspects of response quality beyond mere correctness. RLBFF extracts principles that can be answered in a binary fashion (e.g. accuracy of information: yes, or code readability: no) from natural language feedback. Such principles can then be used to ground Reward Model training as an entailment task (response satisfies or does not satisfy an arbitrary principle). We show that Reward Models trained in this manner can outperform Bradley-Terry models when matched for data and achieve top performance on RM-Bench (86.2%) and JudgeBench (81.4%, #1 on leaderboard as of September 24, 2025). Additionally, users can specify principles of interest at inference time to customize the focus of our reward models, in contrast to Bradley-Terry models. Finally, we present a fully open source recipe (including data) to align Qwen3-32B using RLBFF and our Reward Model, to match or exceed the performance of o3-mini and DeepSeek R1 on general alignment benchmarks of MT-Bench, WildBench, and Arena Hard v2 (at <5% of the inference cost). | [🔗 Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21319v1) |

| [Explaining the Origin of TeV Gamma Rays from M87 During High and Low
  States](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21314v1) | Nibedita Mondal, Sandeep Kumar Mondal, Nayantara Gupta | 2025-09-25 | General AI | The detection of very high-energy gamma-rays from M87 can provide crucial insights into particle acceleration and radiation mechanisms in jets. The recent observations by the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO) detector extend the energy range of TeV gamma-ray astronomy, and also the variability study to the TeV energy domain. We have modelled the low state and flare state multi-wavelength spectral energy distributions of M87 within a time-dependent framework. In our model, the low state gamma-ray flux results from the emissions from the sub-parsec and the kilo-parsec scale jets of M87, whereas the flare state gamma-ray flux is mainly produced in the sub-parsec scale jet. We have shown that the spectral and temporal features of the TeV gamma-ray spectrum of M87 are consistent with this two-zone model, where the contribution from the sub-parsec scale jet significantly increases during the flare state. | [🔗 Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21314v1) |
| [Some shape functionals for the $k$-Hessian equation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21313v1) | Alba Lia Masiello, Francesco Salerno | 2025-09-25 | General AI | For a non-empty, bounded, open, and convex set of class $C^2$, we consider the Torsional Rigidity associated to the $k$-Hessian operator. We first prove P\'olya type lower bound for the $k$-Torsional Rigidity in any dimension; then, in order to investigate optimal sets in the P\'olya type inequality, we provide two quantitative estimates. | [🔗 Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21313v1) |
| [Air Quality and Greenhouse Gas Emissions Assessment of Data Centers in
  Texas: Quantifying Impacts and Environmental Tradeoffs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21312v1) | Ebrahim Eslami | 2025-09-25 | General AI | This study assesses air quality (AQ) and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the rapid expansion of data centers in Texas, a major hub due to infrastructure, electricity markets, and business conditions. AQ impacts were separated from GHG emissions to clarify sources, regulations, and mitigation strategies. Electricity consumption and cooling systems dominate GHG emissions, with a 10 megawatt data center generating about 37,668 metric tons CO2 annually, while construction materials and IT equipment add substantial embodied emissions. Local AQ impacts, often overlooked, arise from diesel backup generators, construction equipment, and commuting. Generator testing alone can emit about 12 metric tons of NOx annually per facility, worsening ozone issues in regions such as Houston and Dallas-Fort Worth. Mitigation strategies include advanced cooling, renewable energy procurement, cleaner backup power (fuel cells, batteries), sustainable construction, and standardized reporting. ERCOT forecasts project 39 to 78 gigawatts of new data center load by 2030, potentially leading to 170 to 205 million metric tons of annual CO2 emissions. Aggressive adoption of renewables and advanced technologies could cut emissions by 50 to 80 percent, avoiding 85 to 165 million metric tons of CO2. The study identifies research and policy gaps, including the need for cumulative air dispersion modeling, AQ-specific regulations, and mandatory efficiency standards. Findings underscore the importance of aligning Texas digital infrastructure growth with environmental and community health protections. | [🔗 Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21312v1) |
