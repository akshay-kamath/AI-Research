| [SceneCompleter: Dense 3D Scene Completion for Generative Novel View
  Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10981v1) | Weiliang Chen, Jiayi Bi, Yuanhui Huang, Wenzhao Zheng, Yueqi Duan | 2025-06-12 | Diffusion Models | Generative models have gained significant attention in novel view synthesis (NVS) by alleviating the reliance on dense multi-view captures. However, existing methods typically fall into a conventional paradigm, where generative models first complete missing areas in 2D, followed by 3D recovery techniques to reconstruct the scene, which often results in overly smooth surfaces and distorted geometry, as generative models struggle to infer 3D structure solely from RGB data. In this paper, we propose SceneCompleter, a novel framework that achieves 3D-consistent generative novel view synthesis through dense 3D scene completion. SceneCompleter achieves both visual coherence and 3D-consistent generative scene completion through two key components: (1) a geometry-appearance dual-stream diffusion model that jointly synthesizes novel views in RGBD space; (2) a scene embedder that encodes a more holistic scene understanding from the reference image. By effectively fusing structural and textural information, our method demonstrates superior coherence and plausibility in generative novel view synthesis across diverse datasets.

| [Fine-Grained Perturbation Guidance via Attention Head Selection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10978v1) | Donghoon Ahn, Jiwon Kang, Sanghyun Lee, Minjae Kim, Jaewon Min, Wooseok Jang, Saungwu Lee, Sayak Paul, Susung Hong, Seungryong Kim | 2025-06-12 | Diffusion Models, LLM | Recent guidance methods in diffusion models steer reverse sampling by perturbing the model to construct an implicit weak model and guide generation away from it. Among these approaches, attention perturbation has demonstrated strong empirical performance in unconditional scenarios where classifier-free guidance is not applicable. However, existing attention perturbation methods lack principled approaches for determining where perturbations should be applied, particularly in Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architectures where quality-relevant computations are distributed across layers. In this paper, we investigate the granularity of attention perturbations, ranging from the layer level down to individual attention heads, and discover that specific heads govern distinct visual concepts such as structure, style, and texture quality. Building on this insight, we propose "HeadHunter", a systematic framework for iteratively selecting attention heads that align with user-centric objectives, enabling fine-grained control over generation quality and visual attributes. In addition, we introduce SoftPAG, which linearly interpolates each selected head's attention map toward an identity matrix, providing a continuous knob to tune perturbation strength and suppress artifacts. Our approach not only mitigates the oversmoothing issues of existing layer-level perturbation but also enables targeted manipulation of specific visual styles through compositional head selection. We validate our method on modern large-scale DiT-based text-to-image models including Stable Diffusion 3 and FLUX.1, demonstrating superior performance in both general quality enhancement and style-specific guidance. Our work provides the first head-level analysis of attention perturbation in diffusion models, uncovering interpretable specialization within attention layers and enabling practical design of effective perturbation strategies. | [🔗 Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10978v1) |

| [Rethinking Losses for Diffusion Bridge Samplers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10982v1) | Sebastian Sanokowski, Lukas Gruber, Christoph Bartmann, Sepp Hochreiter, Sebastian Lehner | 2025-06-12 | Optimization, Diffusion Models | Diffusion bridges are a promising class of deep-learning methods for sampling from unnormalized distributions. Recent works show that the Log Variance (LV) loss consistently outperforms the reverse Kullback-Leibler (rKL) loss when using the reparametrization trick to compute rKL-gradients. While the on-policy LV loss yields identical gradients to the rKL loss when combined with the log-derivative trick for diffusion samplers with non-learnable forward processes, this equivalence does not hold for diffusion bridges or when diffusion coefficients are learned. Based on this insight we argue that for diffusion bridges the LV loss does not represent an optimization objective that can be motivated like the rKL loss via the data processing inequality. Our analysis shows that employing the rKL loss with the log-derivative trick (rKL-LD) does not only avoid these conceptual problems but also consistently outperforms the LV loss. Experimental results with different types of diffusion bridges on challenging benchmarks show that samplers trained with the rKL-LD loss achieve better performance. From a practical perspective we find that rKL-LD requires significantly less hyperparameter optimization and yields more stable training behavior. | [🔗 Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10982v1) |
| [InstaInpaint: Instant 3D-Scene Inpainting with Masked Large
  Reconstruction Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10980v1) | Junqi You, Chieh Hubert Lin, Weijie Lyu, Zhengbo Zhang, Ming-Hsuan Yang | 2025-06-12 | Optimization, Multimodal AI | Recent advances in 3D scene reconstruction enable real-time viewing in virtual and augmented reality. To support interactive operations for better immersiveness, such as moving or editing objects, 3D scene inpainting methods are proposed to repair or complete the altered geometry. However, current approaches rely on lengthy and computationally intensive optimization, making them impractical for real-time or online applications. We propose InstaInpaint, a reference-based feed-forward framework that produces 3D-scene inpainting from a 2D inpainting proposal within 0.4 seconds. We develop a self-supervised masked-finetuning strategy to enable training of our custom large reconstruction model (LRM) on the large-scale dataset. Through extensive experiments, we analyze and identify several key designs that improve generalization, textural consistency, and geometric correctness. InstaInpaint achieves a 1000x speed-up from prior methods while maintaining a state-of-the-art performance across two standard benchmarks. Moreover, we show that InstaInpaint generalizes well to flexible downstream applications such as object insertion and multi-region inpainting.

| [How Well Can Reasoning Models Identify and Recover from Unhelpful
  Thoughts?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10979v1) | Sohee Yang, Sang-Woo Lee, Nora Kassner, Daniela Gottesman, Sebastian Riedel, Mor Geva | 2025-06-12 | Scaling Laws, Security & Adversarial ML | Recent reasoning models show the ability to reflect, backtrack, and self-validate their reasoning, which is crucial in spotting mistakes and arriving at accurate solutions. A natural question that arises is how effectively models can perform such self-reevaluation. We tackle this question by investigating how well reasoning models identify and recover from four types of unhelpful thoughts: uninformative rambling thoughts, thoughts irrelevant to the question, thoughts misdirecting the question as a slightly different question, and thoughts that lead to incorrect answers. We show that models are effective at identifying most unhelpful thoughts but struggle to recover from the same thoughts when these are injected into their thinking process, causing significant performance drops. Models tend to naively continue the line of reasoning of the injected irrelevant thoughts, which showcases that their self-reevaluation abilities are far from a general "meta-cognitive" awareness. Moreover, we observe non/inverse-scaling trends, where larger models struggle more than smaller ones to recover from short irrelevant thoughts, even when instructed to reevaluate their reasoning. We demonstrate the implications of these findings with a jailbreak experiment using irrelevant thought injection, showing that the smallest models are the least distracted by harmful-response-triggering thoughts. Overall, our findings call for improvement in self-reevaluation of reasoning models to develop better reasoning and safer systems. | [🔗 Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10979v1) |
