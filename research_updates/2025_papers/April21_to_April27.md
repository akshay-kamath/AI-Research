| [The Sparse Frontier: Sparse Attention Trade-offs in Transformer LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17768v1) | Piotr Nawrot, Robert Li, Renjie Huang, Sebastian Ruder, Kelly Marchisio, Edoardo M. Ponti | 2025-04-24 | LLM, Training & Evaluation, Scaling Laws | Sparse attention offers a promising strategy to extend long-context capabilities in Transformer LLMs, yet its viability, its efficiency-accuracy trade-offs, and systematic scaling studies remain unexplored. To address this gap, we perform a careful comparison of training-free sparse attention methods at varying model scales, sequence lengths, and sparsity levels on a diverse collection of long-sequence tasks-including novel ones that rely on natural language while remaining controllable and easy to evaluate. Based on our experiments, we report a series of key findings: 1) an isoFLOPS analysis reveals that for very long sequences, larger and highly sparse models are preferable to smaller and dense ones. 2) The level of sparsity attainable while statistically guaranteeing accuracy preservation is higher during decoding than prefilling, and correlates with model size in the former. 3) There is no clear strategy that performs best across tasks and phases, with different units of sparsification or budget adaptivity needed for different scenarios. Even moderate sparsity levels often result in significant performance degradation on at least one task, highlighting that sparse attention is not a universal solution. 4) We introduce and validate novel scaling laws specifically tailored for sparse attention, providing evidence that our findings are likely to hold true beyond our range of experiments. Through these insights, we demonstrate that sparse attention is a key tool to enhance the capabilities of Transformer LLMs for processing longer sequences, but requires careful evaluation of trade-offs for performance-sensitive applications. | [üîó Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17768v1) |
| [Fourier Acceleration in a Linear Sigma Model with Spontaneous Symmetry
  Breaking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17747v1) | Cameron Cianci, Luchang Jin, Joshua Swaim | 2025-04-24 | LLM | Fourier acceleration is a technique used in Hybrid Monte Carlo simulations to decrease the autocorrelation between subsequent field configurations in the generated ensemble. It has been shown, in the perturbative limit, to eliminate the problem of critical slowing down in a $\phi^4$ theory (arXiv:1812.05281 [hep-lat]). As a result, there are several techniques that are being explored to generalize Fourier acceleration to work with non-Abelian gauge theories like QCD (arXiv:2112.04556 [hep-lat], arXiv:2108.05486 [hep-lat]). It is hoped that these methods will prove effective at overcoming the problem of critical slowing down, even in the non-perturbative limit. In our work, we show that Fourier acceleration can be applied effectively to a linear sigma model in the symmetry broken phase, leading to reduced autocorrelation and faster thermalization. We present an algorithm for estimating the optimal Fourier acceleration masses dynamically, based on the lattice data. In the future, we hope to explore the effectiveness of these techniques in the strongly-interacting case. Since our $\phi^4$ theory is a linear chiral effective theory for QCD, this could be interesting for those who are seeking to generalize Fourier acceleration to QCD. | [üîó Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17747v1) |

| [LiDPM: Rethinking Point Diffusion for Lidar Scene Completion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17791v1) | Tetiana Martyniuk, Gilles Puy, Alexandre Boulch, Renaud Marlet, Raoul de Charette | 2025-04-24 | Diffusion Models | Training diffusion models that work directly on lidar points at the scale of outdoor scenes is challenging due to the difficulty of generating fine-grained details from white noise over a broad field of view. The latest works addressing scene completion with diffusion models tackle this problem by reformulating the original DDPM as a local diffusion process. It contrasts with the common practice of operating at the level of objects, where vanilla DDPMs are currently used. In this work, we close the gap between these two lines of work. We identify approximations in the local diffusion formulation, show that they are not required to operate at the scene level, and that a vanilla DDPM with a well-chosen starting point is enough for completion. Finally, we demonstrate that our method, LiDPM, leads to better results in scene completion on SemanticKITTI.

| [Token-Shuffle: Towards High-Resolution Image Generation with
  Autoregressive Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17789v1) | Xu Ma, Peize Sun, Haoyu Ma, Hao Tang, Chih-Yao Ma, Jialiang Wang, Kunpeng Li, Xiaoliang Dai, Yujun Shi, Xuan Ju, Yushi Hu, Artsiom Sanakoyeu, Felix Juefei-Xu, Ji Hou, Junjiao Tian, Tao Xu, Tingbo Hou, Yen-Cheng Liu, Zecheng He, Zijian He, Matt Feiszli, Peizhao Zhang, Peter Vajda, Sam Tsai, Yun Fu | 2025-04-24 | Diffusion Models, LLM, RLHF, Multimodal AI | Autoregressive (AR) models, long dominant in language generation, are increasingly applied to image synthesis but are often considered less competitive than Diffusion-based models. A primary limitation is the substantial number of image tokens required for AR models, which constrains both training and inference efficiency, as well as image resolution. To address this, we present Token-Shuffle, a novel yet simple method that reduces the number of image tokens in Transformer. Our key insight is the dimensional redundancy of visual vocabularies in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), where low-dimensional visual codes from visual encoder are directly mapped to high-dimensional language vocabularies. Leveraging this, we consider two key operations: token-shuffle, which merges spatially local tokens along channel dimension to decrease the input token number, and token-unshuffle, which untangles the inferred tokens after Transformer blocks to restore the spatial arrangement for output. Jointly training with textual prompts, our strategy requires no additional pretrained text-encoder and enables MLLMs to support extremely high-resolution image synthesis in a unified next-token prediction way while maintaining efficient training and inference. For the first time, we push the boundary of AR text-to-image generation to a resolution of 2048x2048 with gratifying generation performance. In GenAI-benchmark, our 2.7B model achieves 0.77 overall score on hard prompts, outperforming AR models LlamaGen by 0.18 and diffusion models LDM by 0.15. Exhaustive large-scale human evaluations also demonstrate our prominent image generation ability in terms of text-alignment, visual flaw, and visual appearance. We hope that Token-Shuffle can serve as a foundational design for efficient high-resolution image generation within MLLMs. | [üîó Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17789v1) |
| [Thermal Product Formula for Shear Modes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17781v1) | Jyotirmoy Bhattacharya, Nibedita Padhi, Aditya Sharma, Sourav Singha | 2025-04-24 | Diffusion Models | We investigate the validity of the thermal product formula proposed in ArXiv[2304.12339], for the shear channel fluctuations of R-charged black branes in AdS5 where the shear mode is coupled with charge diffusion mode at non-zero momentum. When these modes are suitably decoupled, we are able to obtain an exact formula for the two point functions of the boundary current and energy-momentum tensor in terms of the quasinormal modes of this channel. This exact formula is a simple modification of the previous version of the product formula. We also obtain a similar formula for the case involving a boundary global R-symmetry anomaly, when we have a bulk Chern-Simons term which introduces additional couplings in the shear channel. Also based on insights from the quasinormal mode spectrum, we report on an instability as well as the presence of high momentum long-lived modes associated with large values of the anomaly coefficient. | [üîó Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17781v1) |
| [Step1X-Edit: A Practical Framework for General Image Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17761v1) | Shiyu Liu, Yucheng Han, Peng Xing, Fukun Yin, Rui Wang, Wei Cheng, Jiaqi Liao, Yingming Wang, Honghao Fu, Chunrui Han, Guopeng Li, Yuang Peng, Quan Sun, Jingwei Wu, Yan Cai, Zheng Ge, Ranchen Ming, Lei Xia, Xianfang Zeng, Yibo Zhu, Binxing Jiao, Xiangyu Zhang, Gang Yu, Daxin Jiang | 2025-04-24 | Diffusion Models, LLM, Training & Evaluation, Multimodal AI | In recent years, image editing models have witnessed remarkable and rapid development. The recent unveiling of cutting-edge multimodal models such as GPT-4o and Gemini2 Flash has introduced highly promising image editing capabilities. These models demonstrate an impressive aptitude for fulfilling a vast majority of user-driven editing requirements, marking a significant advancement in the field of image manipulation. However, there is still a large gap between the open-source algorithm with these closed-source models. Thus, in this paper, we aim to release a state-of-the-art image editing model, called Step1X-Edit, which can provide comparable performance against the closed-source models like GPT-4o and Gemini2 Flash. More specifically, we adopt the Multimodal LLM to process the reference image and the user's editing instruction. A latent embedding has been extracted and integrated with a diffusion image decoder to obtain the target image. To train the model, we build a data generation pipeline to produce a high-quality dataset. For evaluation, we develop the GEdit-Bench, a novel benchmark rooted in real-world user instructions. Experimental results on GEdit-Bench demonstrate that Step1X-Edit outperforms existing open-source baselines by a substantial margin and approaches the performance of leading proprietary models, thereby making significant contributions to the field of image editing. | [üîó Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17761v1) |

In this edition, we revised the evaluation protocol to use least-squares alignment with two degrees of freedom to support disparity and affine-invariant predictions. We also revised the baselines and included popular off-the-shelf methods: Depth Anything v2 and Marigold. The challenge received a total of 24 submissions that outperformed the baselines on the test set; 10 of these included a report describing their approach, with most leading methods relying on affine-invariant predictions. The challenge winners improved the 3D F-Score over the previous edition's best result, raising it from 22.58% to 23.05%. | [üîó Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17787v1) |

| [Dynamic Camera Poses and Where to Find Them](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17788v1) | Chris Rockwell, Joseph Tung, Tsung-Yi Lin, Ming-Yu Liu, David F. Fouhey, Chen-Hsuan Lin | 2025-04-24 | Multimodal AI | Annotating camera poses on dynamic Internet videos at scale is critical for advancing fields like realistic video generation and simulation. However, collecting such a dataset is difficult, as most Internet videos are unsuitable for pose estimation. Furthermore, annotating dynamic Internet videos present significant challenges even for state-of-theart methods. In this paper, we introduce DynPose-100K, a large-scale dataset of dynamic Internet videos annotated with camera poses. Our collection pipeline addresses filtering using a carefully combined set of task-specific and generalist models. For pose estimation, we combine the latest techniques of point tracking, dynamic masking, and structure-from-motion to achieve improvements over the state-of-the-art approaches. Our analysis and experiments demonstrate that DynPose-100K is both large-scale and diverse across several key attributes, opening up avenues for advancements in various downstream applications. | [üîó Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17788v1) |

| [On the Degree Automatability of Sum-of-Squares Proofs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17756v1) | Alex Bortolotti, Monaldo Mastrolilli, Luis Felipe Vargas | 2025-04-24 | Optimization | The Sum-of-Squares (SoS) hierarchy, also known as Lasserre hierarchy, has emerged as a promising tool in optimization. However, it remains unclear whether fixed-degree SoS proofs can be automated [O'Donnell (2017)]. Indeed, there are examples of polynomial systems with bounded coefficients that admit low-degree SoS proofs, but these proofs necessarily involve numbers with an exponential number of bits, implying that low-degree SoS proofs cannot always be found efficiently.   A sufficient condition derived from the Nullstellensatz proof system [Raghavendra and Weitz (2017)] identifies cases where bit complexity issues can be circumvented. One of the main problems left open by Raghavendra and Weitz is proving any result for refutations, as their condition applies only to polynomial systems with a large set of solutions.   In this work, we broaden the class of polynomial systems for which degree-$d$ SoS proofs can be automated. To achieve this, we develop a new criterion and we demonstrate how our criterion applies to polynomial systems beyond the scope of Raghavendra and Weitz's result. In particular, we establish a separation for instances arising from Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs). Moreover, our result extends to refutations, establishing that polynomial-time refutation is possible for broad classes of polynomial time solvable constraint problems, highlighting a first advancement in this area. | [üîó Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17756v1) |

| [Unleashing the Power of Natural Audio Featuring Multiple Sound Sources](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17782v1) | Xize Cheng, Slytherin Wang, Zehan Wang, Rongjie Huang, Tao Jin, Zhou Zhao | 2025-04-24 | Training & Evaluation, Multimodal AI | Universal sound separation aims to extract clean audio tracks corresponding to distinct events from mixed audio, which is critical for artificial auditory perception. However, current methods heavily rely on artificially mixed audio for training, which limits their ability to generalize to naturally mixed audio collected in real-world environments. To overcome this limitation, we propose ClearSep, an innovative framework that employs a data engine to decompose complex naturally mixed audio into multiple independent tracks, thereby allowing effective sound separation in real-world scenarios. We introduce two remix-based evaluation metrics to quantitatively assess separation quality and use these metrics as thresholds to iteratively apply the data engine alongside model training, progressively optimizing separation performance. In addition, we propose a series of training strategies tailored to these separated independent tracks to make the best use of them. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ClearSep achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple sound separation tasks, highlighting its potential for advancing sound separation in natural audio scenarios.

There is a need for controlled, probing evaluations with real stakeholders which can highlight advantages and disadvantages of more traditional architectures and those based on generative AI. We present a within-group user study to compare two versions of a conversational assistant that allows heart failure patients to ask about salt content in food. One version of the system was developed in-house with a neurosymbolic architecture, and one is based on ChatGPT. The evaluation shows that the in-house system is more accurate, completes more tasks and is less verbose than the one based on ChatGPT; on the other hand, the one based on ChatGPT makes fewer speech errors and requires fewer clarifications to complete the task. Patients show no preference for one over the other. | [üîó Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17753v1) |

| [Nearby open clusters with tidal features: golden sample selection and 3D
  structure](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17744v1) | Ming Xu, Xiaoting Fu, Yang Chen, Lu Li, Min Fang, He Zhao, Penghui Liu, Yichang Zuo | 2025-04-24 | Model Evaluation, Responsible AI | Open clusters offer unique opportunities to study stellar dynamics and evolution under the influence of their internal gravity, the Milky Way's gravitational field, and the interactions with encounters. Using the Gaia DR3 data for a catalog of open clusters within 500 parsecs that exhibit tidal features reported by the literature, we apply a novel method based on 3D principal component analysis to select a ``golden sample'' of nearby open clusters with minimal line-of-sight distortions. This approach ensures a systematic comparison of 3D and 2D structural parameters for tidally perturbed clusters. The selected golden sample includes Blanco 1, Melotte 20, Melotte 22, NGC 2632, NGC 7092, NGC 1662, Roslund 6 and Melotte 111. We analyze these clusters by fitting both 2D and 3D King Profiles to their stellar density distributions. Our results reveal systematic discrepancies: most of the golden sample clusters exhibit larger 3D tidal radii compared to their 2D counterparts, demonstrating that the 2D projection effects bias the measured cluster size. Furthermore, the 3D density profiles show stronger deviations from King profiles at the tidal radii ($\Delta \rho_{\rm 3D} > \Delta \rho_{\rm 2D}$), highlighting enhanced sensitivity to tidal disturbances. Additionally, we investigate the spatial distribution of cluster members relative to their bulk motion in the Galactic plane. We find that some clusters exhibit tidal features oriented perpendicular to their direction of motion, which can be attributed to the fact that the current surveys only detect the curved inner regions of the tidal features. In conclusion, this work offers a golden sample of nearby open clusters that are most reliable for 3D structure analysis and underscores the necessity of 3D analysis in characterizing OC morphological asymmetries, determining cluster size, and identifying tidal features. | [üîó Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17744v1) |

| [MSGCN: Multiplex Spatial Graph Convolution Network for Interlayer Link
  Weight Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17749v1) | Steven E. Wilson, Sina Khanmohammadi | 2025-04-24 | Graph AI | Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been widely used for various learning tasks, ranging from node classification to link prediction. They have demonstrated excellent performance in multiple domains involving graph-structured data. However, an important category of learning tasks, namely link weight prediction, has received less emphasis due to its increased complexity compared to binary link classification. Link weight prediction becomes even more challenging when considering multilayer networks, where nodes can be interconnected across multiple layers. To address these challenges, we propose a new method named Multiplex Spatial Graph Convolution Network (MSGCN), which spatially embeds information across multiple layers to predict interlayer link weights. The MSGCN model generalizes spatial graph convolution to multiplex networks and captures the geometric structure of nodes across multiple layers. Extensive experiments using data with known interlayer link information show that the MSGCN model has robust, accurate, and generalizable link weight prediction performance across a wide variety of multiplex network structures. | [üîó Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17749v1) |

  Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17780v1) | Sneh Pillai | 2025-04-24 | Ongoing Learning, LLM, Training & Evaluation, Optimization | Continual learning in large language models (LLMs) typically encounters the critical challenge of catastrophic forgetting, where previously acquired knowledge deteriorates upon exposure to new data. While techniques like replay buffers and parameter-efficient tuning (e.g., Low-Rank Adaptation or LoRA) have been proposed, few studies investigate real-time domain adaptation under strict computational and data-stream constraints. In this paper, we demonstrate a lightweight method combining LoRA and a minimal replay mechanism in a realistic streaming setting across three diverse knowledge domains: medical question answering, genetics, and law. Using perplexity, semantic similarity, and GPT-based human-like evaluation metrics, we quantify the model's adaptation, forgetting, and recovery over time. Our experiments reveal that while catastrophic forgetting naturally occurs, even minimal replay significantly stabilizes and partially restores domain-specific knowledge. This study contributes practical insights for deploying adaptable LLMs in resource-constrained, real-world scenarios. | [üîó Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17780v1) |

| [Silenzio: Secure Non-Interactive Outsourced MLP Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17785v1) | Jonas Sander, Thomas Eisenbarth | 2025-04-24 | Security & Adversarial ML, Scaling Laws | Outsourcing the ML training to cloud providers presents a compelling opportunity for resource constrained clients, while it simultaneously bears inherent privacy risks, especially for highly sensitive training data. We introduce Silenzio, the first fully non-interactive outsourcing scheme for the training of multi-layer perceptrons that achieves 128 bit security using FHE. Unlike traditional MPC based protocols that necessitate interactive communication between the client and server(s) or non-collusion assumptions among multiple servers, Silenzio enables the fire-and-forget paradigm without such assumptions. In this approach, the client encrypts the training data once, and the cloud server performs the training without any further interaction.   Silenzio operates over low bitwidth integers - never exceeding 8 bit - to mitigate the computational overhead of FHE. Our approach features a novel low-bitwidth matrix multiplication that leverages input-dependent residue number systems and a Karatsuba-inspired multiplication routine, ensuring that no intermediate FHE-processed value overflows 8 bit. Starting from an RNS-to-MRNS conversion process, we propose an efficient block-scaling mechanism, which approximately shifts encrypted tensor values to the user-specified most significant bits. To instantiate the backpropagation of the error, Silenzio introduces a low-bitwidth and TFHE friendly gradient computation for the cross entropy loss.   Implemented using the state-of-the-art Concrete library, we evaluate Silenzio on standard MLP training tasks regarding runtime as well as model performance and achieve similar classification accuracy as MLPs trained using standard PyTorch with 32 bit floating-point computations. Our open-source implementation represents a significant advancement in privacy-preserving ML, providing a new baseline for secure and non-interactive outsourced MLP training. | [üîó Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17785v1) |

The ICP model unifies SPIFFE-based workload identity, OIDC/SAML user identity, and scoped automation credentials via broker-issued transaction tokens. We propose a composable enforcement layer using ABAC policy engines (e.g., OPA, Cedar), aligned with IETF WIMSE drafts and OAuth transaction tokens. The paper includes architectural components, integration patterns, use cases, a comparative analysis with current models, and theorized performance metrics. A FedRAMP and SLSA compliance mapping is also presented. This is a theoretical infrastructure architecture paper intended for security researchers and platform architects.

| [Quantum Error Correction with Girth-16 Non-Binary LDPC Codes via Affine
  Permutation Construction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17790v1) | Kenta Kasai | 2025-04-24 | General AI | We propose a method for constructing quantum error-correcting codes based on non-binary low-density parity-check codes with girth 16. In conventional constructions using circulant permutation matrices, the girth is upper-bounded by 12, which limits the suppression of harmful short cycles. Our construction employs affine permutation matrices and a randomized sequential selection procedure designed to eliminate short cycles, which are known to limit decoding performance.   Joint belief propagation decoding is applied over depolarizing channels. Numerical experiments confirm that the proposed codes reduce the number of low-weight codewords in $C_X \setminus C_Z^\perp$ and $C_Z \setminus C_X^\perp$, and thus have the potential to suppress error floors. In addition, we obtain a significantly improved upper bound on the minimum distance, which we conjecture to be tight. | [üîó Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17790v1) |
| [Emergent fractals in dirty topological crystals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17786v1) | Daniel J. Salib, Bitan Roy | 2025-04-24 | General AI | Non-trivial geometry of electronic Bloch states gives birth to topological insulators that are robust against sufficiently weak randomness, inevitably present in any quantum material. However, increasing disorder triggers a quantum phase transition into a featureless normal insulator. As the underlying quantum critical point is approached from the topological side, small scattered droplets of normal insulators start to develop in the system and their coherent nucleation causes ultimate condensation of a trivial insulation. Unless disorder is too strong, the normal insulator accommodates disjoint tiny topological puddles. Furthermore, in the close vicinity of such a transition the emergent islands of topological and trivial insulators display spatial fractal structures, a feature that is revealed only by local topological markers. Here we showcase this (possibly) generic phenomenon that should be apposite to dirty topological crystals of any symmetry class in any dimension from the Bott index and local Chern marker for a square lattice-based disordered Chern insulator model. | [üîó Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17786v1) |

  multilayer graphene](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17783v1) | Ludwig Holleis, Liam Cohen, Noah Samuelson, Caitlin L. Patterson, Ysun Choi, Marco Valentini, Owen Sheekey, Youngjoon Choi, Jiaxi Zhou, Hari Stoyanov, Takashi Taniguchi, Kenji Watanabe, Qichi Hu, Jin Hee Kim, Cassandra Phillips, Peter De Wolf, Andrea F. Young | 2025-04-24 | General AI | Graphite occurs in a range of metastable stacking orders characterized by both the number and direction of shifts between adjacent layers by the length of a single carbon-carbon bond. At the extremes are Bernal (or ``ABAB...'') stacking, where the direction of the interlayer shift alternates with each layer, and rhombohedral (or ``ABCABC...'') stacking order where the shifts are always in the same direction. However, for an N-layer system, there are in principle $N-1$ unique metastable stacking orders of this type. Recently, it has become clear that stacking order has a strong effect on the low energy electronic band structure with single-layer shifts completely altering the electronic properties. Most experimental work has focused on the extremal stacking orders in large part due to the difficulty of isolating and identifying intermediate orders. Motivated by this challenge, here we describe two atomic force microscopy (AFM) based techniques to unambiguously distinguish stacking orders and defects in graphite flakes. Photo-thermal infrared atomic force microscope (AFM-IR) is able to distinguish stacking orders across multiple IR wavelengths and readily provides absolute contrast via IR spectral analysis. Scanning microwave impedance microscopy (sMIM) can distinguish the relative contrast between Bernal, intermediate and rhombohedral domains. We show that both techniques are well suited to characterizing graphite van der Waals devices, providing high contrast determination of stacking order, subsurface imaging of graphene flakes buried under a hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) dielectric layer, and identifying nanoscale domain walls. Our results pave the way for the reliable fabrication of graphene multilayer devices of definite interlayer registry. | [üîó Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17783v1) |

Existing approaches fall into two categories: keyframe-based strategies, which predict gripper poses in keyframes and execute them via motion planners, and continuous control methods, which estimate actions sequentially at each timestep. The keyframe-based method lacks inter-frame supervision, struggling to perform consistently or execute curved motions, while the continuous method suffers from weaker spatial perception. To address these issues, this paper introduces an end-to-end framework PPI (keyPose and Pointflow Interface), which integrates the prediction of target gripper poses and object pointflow with the continuous actions estimation. These interfaces enable the model to effectively attend to the target manipulation area, while the overall framework guides diverse and collision-free trajectories. By combining interface predictions with continuous actions estimation, PPI demonstrates superior performance in diverse bimanual manipulation tasks, providing enhanced spatial localization and satisfying flexibility in handling movement restrictions. In extensive evaluations, PPI significantly outperforms prior methods in both simulated and real-world experiments, achieving state-of-the-art performance with a +16.1% improvement on the RLBench2 simulation benchmark and an average of +27.5% gain across four challenging real-world tasks. Notably, PPI exhibits strong stability, high precision, and remarkable generalization capabilities in real-world scenarios.

| [Josephson anomalous vortices](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17779v1) | Dan Crawford, Stefan Iliƒá, Pauli Virtanen, Tero T. Heikkil√§ | 2025-04-24 | General AI | We show that vortices with circulating current, related with odd-frequency triplet pairing, appear in Josephson junctions where the barrier is a weak ferromagnet with strong spin-orbit coupling. By both symmetry analysis and microscopic methods we show that there is an additional term - a rotary invariant - in the superconducting free energy which allows for magnetoelectric effects even when the previously considered Lifshitz invariant vanishes. We show that the size, shape, and position of these vortices can be controlled by manipulating Rashba spin-orbit coupling in the weak link, via gates, and we suggest that these vortices could be detected via scanning magnetometry techniques. We also show that the transverse triplet components of the superconducting correlations can form a texture. | [üîó Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17779v1) |
| [Flexoelectric polarization in chiral liquid crystals: electrostatic
  self-interactions of topological defects](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17778v1) | Paul Leask | 2025-04-24 | General AI | The presence of topological defects in apolar chiral liquid crystals cause orientational distortions, leading to non-uniform strain. This non-uniform strain generates an electric polarization response due to the flexoelectric effect, which induces an internal electric field. Associated to this electric field is an electrostatic self-energy, which has a back-reaction on the director field. Calculation of this internal electric field and its resulting back-reaction on the director field is complicated. We propose a method to do such, adapting a method recently developed to study the magnetostatic self-interaction effect on skyrmions in chiral ferromagnets. Bloch skyrmions in chiral magnets are solenoidal and are unaffected by the magnetostatic self-interaction. However, Bloch skyrmions in liquid crystals yield non-solenoidal flexoelectric polarization and, thus, are affected by the electrostatic self-interaction. Additionally, as the flexoelectric coefficients are increased in strength, a transition from a hopfion to a skyrmion is observed in three-dimensional confined systems. | [üîó Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17778v1) |

  and Candidates](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17777v1) | Qihang Chen, Liang Jing, Xingyu Zhu, Yue Fang, Zizhao He, Zhuojun Deng, Cheng Xiang, Jianghua Wu | 2025-04-24 | General AI | Quasar pair, a special subclass of galaxy pair, is valuable in the investigation of quasar interaction, co-evolution, merger, and clustering, as well as the formation and evolution of galaxies and supermassive black holes. However, quasar pairs at kpc-scale are rare in the universe. The scarcity of available samples hindered the deeper exploration and statistics of these objects. In this work, we apply an astrometric method to systematically search for quasar candidates within a transverse distance of 100 kpc to known quasars in the Million Quasar Catalog. These candidates are ${\it Gaia}$ sources with zero proper motion and zero parallax, which are the kinematic characteristics of extragalactic sources. Visual inspection of the sample was performed to remove the contamination of dense stellar fields and nearby galaxies. A total of 4,062 quasar pair candidates were isolated, with the median member separation, ${\it Gaia}$ G-band magnitude, and redshift of 8.81$^{\prime\prime}$, 20.49, and 1.59, respectively. Our catalog was compared with three major candidate quasar pair catalogs and identified 3,964 new quasar pair candidates previously uncataloged in the three catalogs. Extensive spectroscopic follow-up campaigns are being carried out to validate their astrophysical nature. Several interesting quasar pair candidates are highlighted and discussed. We also briefly discussed several techniques for improving the success rate of quasar pair selection. | [üîó Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17777v1) |
| [Fitting Tree Metrics and Ultrametrics in Data Streams](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17776v1) | Amir Carmel, Debarati Das, Evangelos Kipouridis, Evangelos Pipis | 2025-04-24 | General AI | Fitting distances to tree metrics and ultrametrics are two widely used methods in hierarchical clustering, primarily explored within the context of numerical taxonomy. Given a positive distance function $D:\binom{V}{2}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}_{>0}$, the goal is to find a tree (or ultrametric) $T$ including all elements of set $V$ such that the difference between the distances among vertices in $T$ and those specified by $D$ is minimized. In this paper, we initiate the study of ultrametric and tree metric fitting problems in the semi-streaming model, where the distances between pairs of elements from $V$ (with $ V =n$), defined by the function $D$, can arrive in an arbitrary order. We study these problems under various distance norms:   For the $\ell_0$ objective, we provide a single-pass polynomial-time $\tilde{O}(n)$-space $O(1)$ approximation algorithm for ultrametrics and prove that no single-pass exact algorithm exists, even with exponential time.   Next, we show that the algorithm for $\ell_0$ implies an $O(\Delta/\delta)$ approximation for the $\ell_1$ objective, where $\Delta$ is the maximum and $\delta$ is the minimum absolute difference between distances in the input. This bound matches the best-known approximation for the RAM model using a combinatorial algorithm when $\Delta/\delta=O(n)$.   For the $\ell_\infty$ objective, we provide a complete characterization of the ultrametric fitting problem. We present a single-pass polynomial-time $\tilde{O}(n)$-space 2-approximation algorithm and show that no better than 2-approximation is possible, even with exponential time. We also show that, with an additional pass, it is possible to achieve a polynomial-time exact algorithm for ultrametrics.   Finally, we extend the results for all these objectives to tree metrics by using only one additional pass through the stream and without asymptotically increasing the approximation factor. | [üîó Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17776v1) |

Staelens, Tamara Evstafyeva, Ulrich Sperhake | 2025-04-24 | General AI | We study the stability of ultracompact boson stars admitting light rings combining a perturbative analysis with 3+1 numerical-relativity simulations with and without symmetry assumptions. We observe excellent agreement between all perturbative and numerical results which uniformly support the hypothesis that this family of black-hole mimickers is separated into stable and unstable branches by extremal-mass configurations. This separation includes, in particular, thin-shell boson stars with light rings located on the stable branch which we conclude to represent long-term stable black-hole mimickers. | [üîó Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17775v1) |

Zhang, A. Bret, F. Garc√≠a-Rubio | 2025-04-24 | General AI | Energy partition between ions and electrons in collisionless shocks has long been an unsolved fundamental physical problem. We show that kinetic simulations of moderate Alfv\'enic Mach number, magnetized, collisionless shocks reveal rapid, faster-than-Coulomb, energy exchange between ions and electrons when the plasma is sufficiently magnetized. Using kinetic and multi-fluid models with counter-streaming ions, we identify resonances between electron whistler and ion magnetohydrodynamic waves that account for this rapid energy exchange. | [üîó Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17774v1) |

This explains the ``coincidence'' that no counterexample is known to Grabowski and Mathieu's long-standing conjecture despite the folklore that the conservation of local charges of order higher than 4 imposes additional constraints not implied by the conservation of the three-local charge. | [üîó Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17773v1) |

  bulk chiral magnetic skyrmions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17772v1) | Paul Leask, Martin Speight | 2025-04-24 | General AI | It is known that the magnetization in a ferromagnet induces an internal demagnetizing magnetic field. This, in-turn, generates a magnetostatic self-energy, coming from dipole-dipole interactions. In general, this energy is singular and intrinsically non-local. However, one can introduce a magnetic scalar potential associated with the demagnetizing field. We show that computation of the magnetic potential can be achieved by solving Poisson's equation where the source is the divergence of the magnetization. Furthermore, we determine the variation of the magnetostatic self-energy and its associated back-reaction on the magnetization. Then, we present a theoretical study of the effect of the long-range dipolar interaction on magnetic skyrmion textures in the bulk of chiral ferromagnetic materials with the Dzyaloshinskii--Moriya interaction. It is observed that the demagnetizing dipolar self-interaction can stabilize antiskyrmion crystals in Heusler compounds. | [üîó Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17772v1) |

However, no existing work has harmonized learning-based policy with model-based methods to reduce training complexity and ensure the safety and stability for agile badminton robot control. In this paper, we introduce \ourmethod, a novel hybrid control system for agile badminton robots. Specifically, we propose a model-based strategy for chassis locomotion which provides a base for arm policy. We introduce a physics-informed ``IL+RL'' training framework for learning-based arm policy. In this train framework, a model-based strategy with privileged information is used to guide arm policy training during both IL and RL phases. In addition, we train the critic model during IL phase to alleviate the performance drop issue when transitioning from IL to RL. We present results on our self-engineered badminton robot, achieving 94.5% success rate against the serving machine and 90.7% success rate against human players. Our system can be easily generalized to other agile mobile manipulation tasks such as agile catching and table tennis.

| [Zeptosecond free-electron compression through temporal lensing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17770v1) | Xin Jin, Cruz I. Velasco, F. Javier Garc√≠a de Abajo | 2025-04-24 | General AI | The pursuit of ever-shorter time scales is a frontier in modern physics, exemplified by the synthesis of attosecond light pulses -- an achievement made possible by coherently superimposing a broad range of photon energies, as required by the uncertainty principle. However, extending this progress into the zeptosecond regime poses significant challenges, as it demands phase-correlated optical spectra spanning hundreds of electronvolts. In this context, electrons offer a compelling alternative to light because they can be coherently manipulated to form broad energy superpositions, as demonstrated by the generation of attosecond pulses in ultrafast electron microscopes. Here, we propose a practical scheme for compressing free electrons into the zeptosecond domain by modulating their wave functions using suitably tailored broadband light fields. Building on recent advances in {free-electron--light--matter} interactions, our method introduces the concept of temporal lensing -- an extension of conventional optical lensing to the time domain -- to produce electron pulses with arbitrarily short durations. | [üîó Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17770v1) |
| [Bringing light into the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation: Consequences
  of its fractal non-Markovian memory kernel for optically induced magnetic
  inertia and magnons](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17769v1) | Felipe Reyes-Osorio, Branislav K. Nikolic | 2025-04-24 | General AI | The Landau-Lisfhitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation has been the cornerstone of modeling the dynamics of localized spins, viewed as classical vectors of fixed length, within nonequilibrium magnets. When light is employed as the nonequilibrium drive, the LLG equation must be supplemented with additional terms that are usually conjectured using phenomenological arguments for direct opto-magnetic coupling between localized spins and (real or effective) magnetic field of light. However, direct coupling of magnetic field to spins is 1/c smaller than coupling of light and electrons; or both magnetic and electric fields are too fast for slow classical spins to be able to follow them. Here, we displace the need for phenomenological arguments by rigorously deriving an extended LLG equation via Schwinger-Keldysh field theory (SKFT). Within such a theory, light interacts with itinerant electrons, and then spin current carried by them exerts spin-transfer torque onto localized spins, so that when photoexcited electrons are integrated out we arrive at a spin-only equation. Unlike the standard phenomenological LLG equation with local-in-time Gilbert damping, our extended one contains a non-Markovian memory kernel whose plot within the plane of its two times variables exhibits fractal properties. By applying SKFT-derived extended LLG equation, as our central result, to a light-driven ferromagnet as an example, we predict an optically induced magnetic inertia term. Its magnitude is governed by spatially nonlocal and time-dependent prefactor, leading to excitation of coherent magnons at sharp frequencies in and outside of the band of incoherent (or thermal) magnons. | [üîó Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17769v1) |
| [Dynamic atmosphere and wind models of C-type asymptotic giant branch
  stars. Influences of dust optical data on mass loss and observables](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17767v1) | Emelie Siderud, Kjell Eriksson, Susanne H√∂fner, Sara Bladh | 2025-04-24 | General AI | Mass loss through stellar winds governs the evolution of stars on the asymptotic giant branch (AGB). In the case of carbon-rich AGB stars, the wind is believed to be driven by radiation pressure on amorphous carbon (amC) dust forming in the atmosphere. The choice of dust optical data will have a significant impact on atmosphere and wind models of AGB stars. We compare two commonly used optical data sets of amC and investigate how the wind characteristics and photometric properties resulting from dynamical models of carbon-rich AGB stars are influenced by the micro-physical properties of dust grains. We computed two extensive grids of carbon star atmosphere and wind models with the DARWIN 1D radiation-hydrodynamical code. Each of the two grids uses a different amC optical data set. The stellar parameters of the models were varied to cover a wide range of possible combinations. A posteriori radiative transfer calculations were performed for a sub-set of the models, resulting in photometric fluxes and colours. We find small, but systematic differences in the predicted mass-loss rates for the two grids. The grain sizes and photometric properties are affected by the different dust optical data sets. Higher absorption efficiency leads to the formation of a greater number of grains, which are smaller. Models that are obscured by dust exhibit differences in terms of the covered colour range compared to observations, depending on the dust optical data used. An important motivation for this study was to investigate how strongly the predicted mass-loss rates depend on the choice of dust optical data, as these mass-loss values are more frequently used in stellar evolution models. Based on the current results, we conclude that mass-loss rates may typically differ by about a factor of two for DARWIN models of C-type AGB stars for commonly used dust optical data sets. | [üîó Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17767v1) |

We explore the possibility that in a near future the FOCAL detector could be used to measure the jet at forward rapidities, with the associated meson being measured by a central or forward detector, and estimate the rapidity distributions for the $\rho$ + jet and $J/\Psi$ + jet photoproduction in $pp$, $Pbp$ and $PbPb$ collisions. We demonstrate that the associated cross-sections are non - negligible and that a future experimental analysis can be useful to constrain the description of the BFKL kernel and improve our understanding of the QCD dynamics. | [üîó Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17766v1) |

Barros Jr | 2025-04-24 | General AI | We present new solutions to the Klein-Gordon equation for a scalar particle in a black string spacetime immersed in an anisotropic quintessence fluid surrounded by a cloud of strings, extending the analysis presented in our previous work. These novel solutions are dependent on the quintessence state parameter, $\alpha_{Q}$, and are now valid for a much larger domain of the radial coordinate. We investigate the cases when $\alpha_{Q} = 0,\,1/2,\,1$, encompassing both black hole and horizonless scenarios. We express the resulting radial wave functions using the confluent and biconfluent Heun functions, with special cases represented by Bessel functions. We derive restrictions on the allowed quantum energy levels by imposing constraints on the Heun parameters to ensure polynomial solutions. Furthermore, we investigate the emergence of "dark phases" associated with the radial wave function, focusing on the interesting case of $\alpha_{Q} = 1$. Our findings provide insights into the dynamics of scalar particles in this complex spacetime and the potential impact of dark energy on quantum systems. | [üîó Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17765v1) |

In this paper, we propose a conceptual algebraic description of orbifolds/condensations for arbitrary tangential structures in terms of higher dagger structures and higher idempotents. In particular, we obtain (oriented) orbifold completion from (framed) condensation completion by using a general strictification procedure for higher dagger structures which we describe explicitly in low dimensions; we also discuss the spin and unoriented case. We provide several examples of higher dagger categories, such as those associated to state sum models, (orbifolds of) Landau--Ginzburg models, and truncated affine Rozansky--Witten models. We also explain how their higher dagger structures are naturally induced from rigid symmetric monoidal structures, recontextualizing and extending results from the literature. | [üîó Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17764v1) |

Furthermore, the spacetimes become totally vicious when $ a >M$, meaning that through every point there exists a closed timelike curve. Despite this, we prove that the Kerr spacetimes do not admit any closed null geodesics when $ a \geq M$. This result generalises recent findings by one of the authors, which showed the nonexistence of closed causal geodesics in the case $ a <M$. Combining these results, we establish the absence of closed null geodesics in Kerr spacetimes for any non-zero $a$. | [üîó Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17763v1) |

This direction is of importance in the context of DUNE sub-GeV atmospheric oscillation studies. MicroBooNE allows for a data-driven quantification of this resolution by investigating the deviation of the reconstructed muon-proton system orientation with respect to the well-known direction of neutrinos originating from the Booster Neutrino Beam with an exposure of 1.3 x 1021 protons on target. Using simulation studies, we derive the expected sub-GeV DUNE atmospheric-neutrino reconstructed simulated spectrum by developing a reweighting scheme as a function of the true neutrino energy. We further report flux-integrated single- and double-differential cross section measurements of charged-current {\nu}{\mu} quasielastic-like scattering on argon as a function of the muon-proton system angle using the full MicroBooNE data sets.

Additionally, we compute for the first time a canonical form for the three-loop banana integral with two unequal masses and for a four-loop banana integral with two unequal masses. For the integrals we compute, we find an $\epsilon$-form whose connection has at most simple poles. We motivate our construction by studying the Picard-Fuchs operators acting on the integrals considered.

Events with the diphoton final state are selected, and the measured inclusive fiducial cross section is $\sigma_\text{fid}$ = 74 $\pm$ 11 (stat) $^{+5}_{-4}$ (syst) fb, in agreement with the standard model prediction of 67.8 $\pm$ 3.8 fb. Differential cross sections are measured as functions of several observables: the Higgs boson transverse momentum and rapidity, the number of associated jets, and the transverse momentum of the leading jet in the event. Within the uncertainties, the differential cross sections agree with the standard model predictions. | [üîó Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17755v1) |
| [Spall strength of symmetric tilt grain boundaries in 6H silicon carbide](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17754v1) | Chunyu Li, Alejandro Strachan | 2025-04-24 | General AI | Characterizing microstructural effects on the dynamical response of materials is challenging due to the extreme conditions and the short timescales involved. For example, little is known about how grain boundary characteristics affect spall strength. This study explores 6H-SiC bicrystals under shock waves via large-scale molecular dynamics simulations. We focused on symmetric tilt grain boundaries with a wide range of misorientations and found that spall strength and dynamical fracture surface energy are strongly affected by the grain boundary microstructure, especially the excess free volume. Grain boundary energy also plays a considerable role. As expected, low-angle grain boundaries tend to have higher spallation strengths. We also extracted cohesive models for the dynamical strength of bulk systems and grain boundaries that can be used in continuum simulations. | [üîó Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17754v1) |
| [Disaggregated Deep Learning via In-Physics Computing at Radio Frequency](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17752v1) | Zhihui Gao, Sri Krishna Vadlamani, Kfir Sulimany, Dirk Englund, Tingjun Chen | 2025-04-24 | General AI | Modern edge devices, such as cameras, drones, and Internet-of-Things nodes, rely on deep learning to enable a wide range of intelligent applications, including object recognition, environment perception, and autonomous navigation. However, deploying deep learning models directly on the often resource-constrained edge devices demands significant memory footprints and computational power for real-time inference using traditional digital computing architectures. In this paper, we present WISE, a novel computing architecture for wireless edge networks designed to overcome energy constraints in deep learning inference. WISE achieves this goal through two key innovations: disaggregated model access via wireless broadcasting and in-physics computation of general complex-valued matrix-vector multiplications directly at radio frequency. Using a software-defined radio platform with wirelessly broadcast model weights over the air, we demonstrate that WISE achieves 95.7% image classification accuracy with ultra-low operation power of 6.0 fJ/MAC per client, corresponding to a computation efficiency of 165.8 TOPS/W. This approach enables energy-efficient deep learning inference on wirelessly connected edge devices, achieving more than two orders of magnitude improvement in efficiency compared to traditional digital computing. | [üîó Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17752v1) |
| [Revisiting Reset Mechanisms in Spiking Neural Networks for Sequential
  Modeling: Specialized Discretization for Binary Activated RNN](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17751v1) | Enqi Zhang | 2025-04-24 | General AI | In the field of image recognition, spiking neural networks (SNNs) have achieved performance comparable to conventional artificial neural networks (ANNs). In such applications, SNNs essentially function as traditional neural networks with quantized activation values. This article focuses on an another alternative perspective,viewing SNNs as binary-activated recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for sequential modeling tasks.From this viewpoint, current SNN architectures face several fundamental challenges in sequence modeling: (1) Traditional models lack effective memory mechanisms for long-range sequence modeling; (2) The biological-inspired components in SNNs (such as reset mechanisms and refractory period applications) remain theoretically under-explored for sequence tasks; (3) The RNN-like computational paradigm in SNNs prevents parallel training across different timesteps.To address these challenges, this study conducts a systematic analysis of the fundamental mechanisms underlying reset operations and refractory periods in binary-activated RNN-based SNN sequence models. We re-examine whether such biological mechanisms are strictly necessary for generating sparse spiking patterns, provide new theoretical explanations and insights, and ultimately propose the fixed-refractory-period SNN architecture for sequence modeling. | [üîó Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17751v1) |
| [Pure Chromo-Natural Inflation: Signatures of Particle Production from
  Weak to Strong Backreaction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17750v1) | Ema Dimastrogiovanni, Matteo Fasiello, Alexandros Papageorgiou, Crist√≥bal Zenteno Gatica | 2025-04-24 | General AI | We consider, in the context of axion-inflation, the \textit{Pure Natural Inflation} (PNI) model coupled with an SU(2) gauge sector via a Chern-Simons term. As the axion rolls down its potential, it dissipates energy in the gauge sector thus sourcing fluctuations of scalar and tensor degrees of freedom therein. Gauge field fluctuations will, in turn, feed primordial gravitational waves as well as curvature perturbations. Remarkably, we can use upcoming cosmological probes to test this mechanism across a vast range of scales, from the CMB to laser interferometers. Due to their flat plateau at large field values, we find that PNI potentials fare better vis-\'{a}-vis CMB observations than the conventional sinusoidal potential of chromo-natural inflation (CNI). We show that, even when the dynamics begin in the weak backreaction regime, the rolling of the axion leads to a build-up of the gauge-quanta production, invariably triggering the strong backreaction of the gauge sector tensors on the background dynamics. This transition results in the copious production of both scalar and tensor perturbations, which we study in detail. The gravitational wave signatures include a rich peak structure with a characteristic scale-dependent chirality, a compelling target for future gravitational wave detectors. Additionally, the peak in scalar perturbations may lead to the formation of primordial black holes, potentially accounting for a significant fraction of the observed dark matter abundance. | [üîó Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17750v1) |
| [Robotic Task Ambiguity Resolution via Natural Language Interaction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17748v1) | Eugenio Chisari, Jan Ole von Hartz, Fabien Despinoy, Abhinav Valada | 2025-04-24 | General AI | Language-conditioned policies have recently gained substantial adoption in robotics as they allow users to specify tasks using natural language, making them highly versatile. While much research has focused on improving the action prediction of language-conditioned policies, reasoning about task descriptions has been largely overlooked. Ambiguous task descriptions often lead to downstream policy failures due to misinterpretation by the robotic agent. To address this challenge, we introduce AmbResVLM, a novel method that grounds language goals in the observed scene and explicitly reasons about task ambiguity. We extensively evaluate its effectiveness in both simulated and real-world domains, demonstrating superior task ambiguity detection and resolution compared to recent state-of-the-art baselines. Finally, real robot experiments show that our model improves the performance of downstream robot policies, increasing the average success rate from 69.6% to 97.1%. We make the data, code, and trained models publicly available at https://ambres.cs.uni-freiburg.de. | [üîó Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17748v1) |
| [Flux tube clustering from magnetic coupling of adjacent type-I and -II
  superconductors in a neutron star: persistent gravitational radiation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17746v1) | K. H. Thong, A. Melatos | 2025-04-24 | General AI | Adjacent type-I and -II proton superconductors in a rotation-powered pulsar are predicted to exist in a metastable state containing macroscopic and quantized flux tubes, respectively. Previous studies show that the type-I and -II regions are coupled magnetically, when macroscopic flux tubes divide dendritically into quantized flux tubes near the type-I-II interface, through a process known as flux branching. The studies assume that the normal-superconducting boundary is sharp, and the quantized flux tubes do not repel mutually. Here the sharp-interface approximation is refined by accounting for magnetic repulsion. It is found that flux tubes in the same flux tree cluster with a minimum-energy separation two to seven times less than that of isolated flux tubes. Neutron vortices pin and cluster about flux trees. We find that the maximum characteristic wave strain $h_0$ of the current quadrupole gravitational radiation emitted by a rectilinear array of clustered vortices exceeds by $(1+N_{\rm v,t})^{1/2}$ the strain $h_0 \sim 10^{-32}(f/30 {\rm Hz})^{5/2} (D/1 {\rm kpc})^{-1}$ emitted by uniformly distributed vortices, where $N_{\rm v,t}$ is the mean number of pinned vortices per flux tree, $f$ is the star's spin frequency, and $D$ is the star's distance from Earth. The factor $(1 + N_{\rm v,t})^{1/2}$ brings $h_0$ close to the sensitivity limit of the current generation of interferometric gravitational wave detectors under certain circumstances, specifically when flux branching forms relatively few (and hence relatively large) flux trees. | [üîó Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17746v1) |
| [Asymptotic attraction with algebraic rates toward fronts of
  dispersive-diffusive Burgers equations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17745v1) | Milena Stanislavova, Atanas G. Stefanov | 2025-04-24 | General AI | Burgers equation is a classic model, which arises in numerous applications. At its very core it is a simple conservation law, which serves as a toy model for various dynamics phenomena. In particular, it supports explicit heteroclinic solutions, both fronts and backs. Their stability has been studied in details. There has been substantial interest in considering dispersive and/or diffusive modifications, which present novel dynamical paradigms in such simple setting. More specificaly, the KdV-Burgers model has been showed to support unique fronts (not all of them monotone!) with fixed values at $\pm \infty$. Many articles, among which \cite{Pego}, \cite{NS1}, \cite{NS2}, have studied the question of stability of monotone (or close to monotone) fronts.   In a breakthrough paper, \cite{BBHY}, the authors have extended these results in several different directions. They have considered a wider range of models. The fronts do not need to be monotone, but are subject of a spectral condition instead. Most importantly the method allows for large perturbations, as long as the heteroclinic conditions at $\pm \infty$ are met. That is, there is asymptotic attraction to the said fronts or equivalently the limit set consist of one point.   The purpose of this paper is to extend the results of \cite{BBHY} by providing explicit algebraic rates of convergence as $t\to \infty$. We bootstrap these results from the results in \cite{BBHY} using additional energy estimates for two important examples namely KdV-Burgers and the fractional Burgers problem. These rates are likely not optimal, but we conjecture that they are algebraic nonetheless. | [üîó Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17745v1) |
| [Realization of Temporally Connected Graphs Based on Degree Sequences](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17743v1) | Arnaud Casteigts, Michelle D√∂ring, Nils Morawietz | 2025-04-24 | General AI | Given an undirected graph $G$, the problem of deciding whether $G$ admits a simple and proper time-labeling that makes it temporally connected is known to be NP-hard (G\"obel et al., 1991). In this article, we relax this problem and ask whether a given degree sequence can be realized as a temporally connected graph. Our main results are a complete characterization of the feasible cases, and a recognition algorithm that runs in $O(n)$ time for graphical degree sequences (realized as simple temporal graphs) and in $O(n+m)$ time for multigraphical degree sequences (realized as non-simple temporal graphs, where the number of time labels on an edge corresponds to the multiplicity of the edge in the multigraph). In fact, these algorithms can be made constructive at essentially no cost. Namely, we give a constructive $O(n+m)$ time algorithm that outputs, for a given (multi)graphical degree sequence $\mathbf{d}$, a temporally connected graph whose underlying (multi)graph is a realization of $\mathbf{d}$, if one exists. | [üîó Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17743v1) |
