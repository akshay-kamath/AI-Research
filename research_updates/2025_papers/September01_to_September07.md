| [Plot'n Polish: Zero-shot Story Visualization and Disentangled Editing
  with Text-to-Image Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04446v1) | Kiymet Akdemir, Jing Shi, Kushal Kafle, Brian Price, Pinar Yanardag | 2025-09-04 | Diffusion Models, Prompt Engineering | Text-to-image diffusion models have demonstrated significant capabilities to generate diverse and detailed visuals in various domains, and story visualization is emerging as a particularly promising application. However, as their use in real-world creative domains increases, the need for providing enhanced control, refinement, and the ability to modify images post-generation in a consistent manner becomes an important challenge. Existing methods often lack the flexibility to apply fine or coarse edits while maintaining visual and narrative consistency across multiple frames, preventing creators from seamlessly crafting and refining their visual stories. To address these challenges, we introduce Plot'n Polish, a zero-shot framework that enables consistent story generation and provides fine-grained control over story visualizations at various levels of detail. | [🔗 Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04446v1) |
| [The Telephone Game: Evaluating Semantic Drift in Unified Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04438v1) | Sabbir Mollah, Rohit Gupta, Sirnam Swetha, Qingyang Liu, Ahnaf Munir, Mubarak Shah | 2025-09-04 | Diffusion Models, Training & Evaluation | Employing a single, unified model (UM) for both visual understanding (image-to-text: I2T) and and visual generation (text-to-image: T2I) has opened a new direction in Visual Language Model (VLM) research. While UMs can also support broader unimodal tasks (e.g., text-to-text, image-to-image), we focus on the core cross-modal pair T2I and I2T, as consistency between understanding and generation is critical for downstream use. Existing evaluations consider these capabilities in isolation: FID and GenEval for T2I, and benchmarks such as MME, MMBench for I2T. These single-pass metrics do not reveal whether a model that understands a concept can also render it, nor whether meaning is preserved when cycling between image and text modalities. To address this, we introduce the Unified Consistency Framework for Unified Models (UCF-UM), a cyclic evaluation protocol that alternates I2T and T2I over multiple generations to quantify semantic drift. UCF formulates 3 metrics: (i) Mean Cumulative Drift (MCD), an embedding-based measure of overall semantic loss; (ii) Semantic Drift Rate (SDR), that summarizes semantic decay rate; and (iii) Multi-Generation GenEval (MGG), an object-level compliance score extending GenEval. To assess generalization beyond COCO, which is widely used in training; we create a new benchmark ND400, sampled from NoCaps and DOCCI and evaluate on seven recent models. UCF-UM reveals substantial variation in cross-modal stability: some models like BAGEL maintain semantics over many alternations, whereas others like Vila-u drift quickly despite strong single-pass scores. Our results highlight cyclic consistency as a necessary complement to standard I2T and T2I evaluations, and provide practical metrics to consistently assess unified model's cross-modal stability and strength of their shared representations.

| [Towards Cognitively-Faithful Decision-Making Models to Improve AI
  Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04445v1) | Cyrus Cousins, Vijay Keswani, Vincent Conitzer, Hoda Heidari, Jana Schaich Borg, Walter Sinnott-Armstrong | 2025-09-04 | RLHF | Recent AI work trends towards incorporating human-centric objectives, with the explicit goal of aligning AI models to personal preferences and societal values. Using standard preference elicitation methods, researchers and practitioners build models of human decisions and judgments, which are then used to align AI behavior with that of humans. However, models commonly used in such elicitation processes often do not capture the true cognitive processes of human decision making, such as when people use heuristics to simplify information associated with a decision problem. As a result, models learned from people's decisions often do not align with their cognitive processes, and can not be used to validate the learning framework for generalization to other decision-making tasks. To address this limitation, we take an axiomatic approach to learning cognitively faithful decision processes from pairwise comparisons. Building on the vast literature characterizing the cognitive processes that contribute to human decision-making, and recent work characterizing such processes in pairwise comparison tasks, we define a class of models in which individual features are first processed and compared across alternatives, and then the processed features are then aggregated via a fixed rule, such as the Bradley-Terry rule. This structured processing of information ensures such models are realistic and feasible candidates to represent underlying human decision-making processes. We demonstrate the efficacy of this modeling approach in learning interpretable models of human decision making in a kidney allocation task, and show that our proposed models match or surpass the accuracy of prior models of human pairwise decision-making. | [🔗 Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04445v1) |
| [Extreme Starlight Polarization Efficiency Toward $ζ$ Ophiuchi: A
  Case for Line-of-Sight Foreground Subtraction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04427v1) | Jordan A. Bartlett, Henry A. Kobulnicky | 2025-09-04 | RLHF | Despite the pervasive nature of interstellar dust and its impact on nearly all observations, most dust corrections employ line-of-sight averages over large angular scales. This neglects real variations on small angular and distance scales from discrete components of the ISM. We use $V$ band polarimetry, public dust maps, and Gaia DR3 distances of 25 stars along a 50' radius sight line towards the O9.5IV star $\zeta$ Ophiuchi ($d \approx $ 182 pc) to examine both dust and magnetic structures over the range $d = $ 36--1176 pc and angular scales of $< 1$\degr. Polarization and reddening data indicate two discrete dust populations having different magnetic field orientations along the sight line, one at $d \simeq$ 86--127 pc and another at $d\simeq$ 252--287 pc. After removal of the foreground, the more distant component exhibits alignment in polarization angle with 12 $\mu$m PAH striations seen in the field. This more distant dust population exhibits evidence of extreme starlight polarization efficiency with an average of 14.1% mag$^{-1}$, greater than the canonical Serkowski limit of 9% mag$^{-1}$. The spatial coincidence with the PAH striations indicates the PAH-emitting grains and those responsible for the high polarization efficiency may be components of the same dust population. We find no evidence that $\zeta$ Oph's radiative influence affects the polarizing or reddening properties of the surrounding dust. Our study demonstrates that accurate distance-based foreground subtraction is vital to properly understanding superimposed dust and the magnetic field components in the ISM. | [🔗 Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04427v1) |

| [Virtual Fitting Room: Generating Arbitrarily Long Videos of Virtual
  Try-On from a Single Image -- Technical Preview](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04450v1) | Jun-Kun Chen, Aayush Bansal, Minh Phuoc Vo, Yu-Xiong Wang | 2025-09-04 | Multimodal AI | We introduce the Virtual Fitting Room (VFR), a novel video generative model that produces arbitrarily long virtual try-on videos. Our VFR models long video generation tasks as an auto-regressive, segment-by-segment generation process, eliminating the need for resource-intensive generation and lengthy video data, while providing the flexibility to generate videos of arbitrary length. The key challenges of this task are twofold: ensuring local smoothness between adjacent segments and maintaining global temporal consistency across different segments. To address these challenges, we propose our VFR framework, which ensures smoothness through a prefix video condition and enforces consistency with the anchor video -- a 360-degree video that comprehensively captures the human's wholebody appearance. Our VFR generates minute-scale virtual try-on videos with both local smoothness and global temporal consistency under various motions, making it a pioneering work in long virtual try-on video generation. | [🔗 Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04450v1) |
| [TRUST-VL: An Explainable News Assistant for General Multimodal
  Misinformation Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04448v1) | Zehong Yan, Peng Qi, Wynne Hsu, Mong Li Lee | 2025-09-04 | Multimodal AI, AI Safety, Prompt Engineering | Multimodal misinformation, encompassing textual, visual, and cross-modal distortions, poses an increasing societal threat that is amplified by generative AI. Existing methods typically focus on a single type of distortion and struggle to generalize to unseen scenarios. In this work, we observe that different distortion types share common reasoning capabilities while also requiring task-specific skills. We hypothesize that joint training across distortion types facilitates knowledge sharing and enhances the model's ability to generalize. To this end, we introduce TRUST-VL, a unified and explainable vision-language model for general multimodal misinformation detection. TRUST-VL incorporates a novel Question-Aware Visual Amplifier module, designed to extract task-specific visual features. To support training, we also construct TRUST-Instruct, a large-scale instruction dataset containing 198K samples featuring structured reasoning chains aligned with human fact-checking workflows. Extensive experiments on both in-domain and zero-shot benchmarks demonstrate that TRUST-VL achieves state-of-the-art performance, while also offering strong generalization and interpretability. | [🔗 Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04448v1) |
| [One Flight Over the Gap: A Survey from Perspective to Panoramic Vision](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04444v1) | Xin Lin, Xian Ge, Dizhe Zhang, Zhaoliang Wan, Xianshun Wang, Xiangtai Li, Wenjie Jiang, Bo Du, Dacheng Tao, Ming-Hsuan Yang, Lu Qi | 2025-09-04 | Multimodal AI | Driven by the demand for spatial intelligence and holistic scene perception, omnidirectional images (ODIs), which provide a complete 360\textdegree{} field of view, are receiving growing attention across diverse applications such as virtual reality, autonomous driving, and embodied robotics. Despite their unique characteristics, ODIs exhibit remarkable differences from perspective images in geometric projection, spatial distribution, and boundary continuity, making it challenging for direct domain adaption from perspective methods. This survey reviews recent panoramic vision techniques with a particular emphasis on the perspective-to-panorama adaptation. We first revisit the panoramic imaging pipeline and projection methods to build the prior knowledge required for analyzing the structural disparities. Then, we summarize three challenges of domain adaptation: severe geometric distortions near the poles, non-uniform sampling in Equirectangular Projection (ERP), and periodic boundary continuity. Building on this, we cover 20+ representative tasks drawn from more than 300 research papers in two dimensions. On one hand, we present a cross-method analysis of representative strategies for addressing panoramic specific challenges across different tasks. On the other hand, we conduct a cross-task comparison and classify panoramic vision into four major categories: visual quality enhancement and assessment, visual understanding, multimodal understanding, and visual generation. In addition, we discuss open challenges and future directions in data, models, and applications that will drive the advancement of panoramic vision research. We hope that our work can provide new insight and forward looking perspectives to advance the development of panoramic vision technologies.

| [Self-adaptive Dataset Construction for Real-World Multimodal Safety
  Scenarios](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04403v1) | Jingen Qu, Lijun Li, Bo Zhang, Yichen Yan, Jing Shao | 2025-09-04 | Multimodal AI, Optimization, Training & Evaluation | Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are rapidly evolving, presenting increasingly complex safety challenges. However, current dataset construction methods, which are risk-oriented, fail to cover the growing complexity of real-world multimodal safety scenarios (RMS). And due to the lack of a unified evaluation metric, their overall effectiveness remains unproven. This paper introduces a novel image-oriented self-adaptive dataset construction method for RMS, which starts with images and end constructing paired text and guidance responses. Using the image-oriented method, we automatically generate an RMS dataset comprising 35k image-text pairs with guidance responses. Additionally, we introduce a standardized safety dataset evaluation metric: fine-tuning a safety judge model and evaluating its capabilities on other safety datasets.Extensive experiments on various tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed image-oriented pipeline. The results confirm the scalability and effectiveness of the image-oriented approach, offering a new perspective for the construction of real-world multimodal safety datasets. | [🔗 Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04403v1) |

| [Solving Zero-Sum Games with Fewer Matrix-Vector Products](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04426v1) | Ishani Karmarkar, Liam O'Carroll, Aaron Sidford | 2025-09-04 | Optimization | In this paper we consider the problem of computing an $\epsilon$-approximate Nash Equilibrium of a zero-sum game in a payoff matrix $A \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$ with $O(1)$-bounded entries given access to a matrix-vector product oracle for $A$ and its transpose $A^\top$. We provide a deterministic algorithm that solves the problem using $\tilde{O}(\epsilon^{-8/9})$-oracle queries, where $\tilde{O}(\cdot)$ hides factors polylogarithmic in $m$, $n$, and $\epsilon^{-1}$. Our result improves upon the state-of-the-art query complexity of $\tilde{O}(\epsilon^{-1})$ established by [Nemirovski, 2004] and [Nesterov, 2005]. We obtain this result through a general framework that yields improved deterministic query complexities for solving a broader class of minimax optimization problems which includes computing a linear classifier (hard-margin support vector machine) as well as linear regression. | [🔗 Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04426v1) |
| [Global Convergence and Acceleration for Single Observation Gradient Free
  Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04424v1) | Caio Kalil Lauand, Sean Meyn | 2025-09-04 | Optimization | Simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation (SPSA) is an approach to gradient-free optimization introduced by Spall as a simplification of the approach of Kiefer and Wolfowitz. In many cases the most attractive option is the single-sample version known as 1SPSA, which is the focus of the present paper, containing two major contributions: a modification of the algorithm designed to ensure convergence from arbitrary initial condition, and a new approach to exploration to dramatically accelerate the rate of convergence. Examples are provided to illustrate the theory, and to demonstrate that estimates from unmodified 1SPSA may diverge even for a quadratic objective function. | [🔗 Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04424v1) |
| [SAFE--MA--RRT: Multi-Agent Motion Planning with Data-Driven Safety
  Certificates](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04413v1) | Babak Esmaeili, Hamidreza Modares | 2025-09-04 | Optimization | This paper proposes a fully data-driven motion-planning framework for homogeneous linear multi-agent systems that operate in shared, obstacle-filled workspaces without access to explicit system models. Each agent independently learns its closed-loop behavior from experimental data by solving convex semidefinite programs that generate locally invariant ellipsoids and corresponding state-feedback gains. These ellipsoids, centered along grid-based waypoints, certify the dynamic feasibility of short-range transitions and define safe regions of operation. A sampling-based planner constructs a tree of such waypoints, where transitions are allowed only when adjacent ellipsoids overlap, ensuring invariant-to-invariant transitions and continuous safety. All agents expand their trees simultaneously and are coordinated through a space-time reservation table that guarantees inter-agent safety by preventing simultaneous occupancy and head-on collisions. Each successful edge in the tree is equipped with its own local controller, enabling execution without re-solving optimization problems at runtime. The resulting trajectories are not only dynamically feasible but also provably safe with respect to both environmental constraints and inter-agent collisions. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach in synthesizing synchronized, safe trajectories for multiple agents under shared dynamics and constraints, using only data and convex optimization tools. | [🔗 Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04413v1) |

| [EMMA: Scaling Mobile Manipulation via Egocentric Human Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04443v1) | Lawrence Y. Zhu, Pranav Kuppili, Ryan Punamiya, Patcharapong Aphiwetsa, Dhruv Patel, Simar Kareer, Sehoon Ha, Danfei Xu | 2025-09-04 | Scaling Laws | Scaling mobile manipulation imitation learning is bottlenecked by expensive mobile robot teleoperation. We present Egocentric Mobile MAnipulation (EMMA), an end-to-end framework training mobile manipulation policies from human mobile manipulation data with static robot data, sidestepping mobile teleoperation. To accomplish this, we co-train human full-body motion data with static robot data. In our experiments across three real-world tasks, EMMA demonstrates comparable performance to baselines trained on teleoperated mobile robot data (Mobile ALOHA), achieving higher or equivalent task performance in full task success. We find that EMMA is able to generalize to new spatial configurations and scenes, and we observe positive performance scaling as we increase the hours of human data, opening new avenues for scalable robotic learning in real-world environments.

| [Echo State Networks as State-Space Models: A Systems Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04422v1) | Pradeep Singh, Balasubramanian Raman | 2025-09-04 | Scaling Laws | Echo State Networks (ESNs) are typically presented as efficient, readout-trained recurrent models, yet their dynamics and design are often guided by heuristics rather than first principles. We recast ESNs explicitly as state-space models (SSMs), providing a unified systems-theoretic account that links reservoir computing with classical identification and modern kernelized SSMs. First, we show that the echo-state property is an instance of input-to-state stability for a contractive nonlinear SSM and derive verifiable conditions in terms of leak, spectral scaling, and activation Lipschitz constants. Second, we develop two complementary mappings: (i) small-signal linearizations that yield locally valid LTI SSMs with interpretable poles and memory horizons; and (ii) lifted/Koopman random-feature expansions that render the ESN a linear SSM in an augmented state, enabling transfer-function and convolutional-kernel analyses. This perspective yields frequency-domain characterizations of memory spectra and clarifies when ESNs emulate structured SSM kernels. Third, we cast teacher forcing as state estimation and propose Kalman/EKF-assisted readout learning, together with EM for hyperparameters (leak, spectral radius, process/measurement noise) and a hybrid subspace procedure for spectral shaping under contraction constraints. | [🔗 Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04422v1) |
| [Relative Localization of UAV Swarms in GNSS-Denied Conditions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04412v1) | Guangyu Lei, Yuqi Ping, Tianhao Liang, Huahao Ding, Tingting Zhang | 2025-09-04 | Scaling Laws | Relative localization of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarms in global navigation satellite system (GNSS) denied environments is essential for emergency rescue and battlefield reconnaissance. Existing methods suffer from significant localization errors among UAVs due to packet loss and high computational complexity in large swarms. This paper proposes a clustering-based framework where the UAVs simultaneously use communication signals for channel estimation and ranging. Firstly, the spectral clustering is utilized to divide the UAV swarm into different sub-clusters, where matrix completion and multidimensional scaling yield high-precision relative coordinates. Subsequently, a global map is created by the inter-cluster anchor fusion. A case study of UAV integrated communication and sensing (ISAC) system is presented, where the Orthogonal Time Frequency Space (OTFS) is adopted for ranging and communication. Experimental results show that the proposed method reduces localization errors in large swarms and loss of range information. It also explores the impact of signal parameters on communication and localization, highlighting the interplay between communication and localization performance. | [🔗 Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04412v1) |

| [Can Language Models Handle a Non-Gregorian Calendar?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04432v1) | Mutsumi Sasaki, Go Kamoda, Ryosuke Takahashi, Kosuke Sato, Kentaro Inui, Keisuke Sakaguchi, Benjamin Heinzerling | 2025-09-04 | Training & Evaluation | Temporal reasoning and knowledge are essential capabilities for language models (LMs). While much prior work has analyzed and improved temporal reasoning in LMs, most studies have focused solely on the Gregorian calendar. However, many non-Gregorian systems, such as the Japanese, Hijri, and Hebrew calendars, are in active use and reflect culturally grounded conceptions of time. If and how well current LMs can accurately handle such non-Gregorian calendars has not been evaluated so far. Here, we present a systematic evaluation of how well open-source LMs handle one such non-Gregorian system: the Japanese calendar. For our evaluation, we create datasets for four tasks that require both temporal knowledge and temporal reasoning. Evaluating a range of English-centric and Japanese-centric LMs, we find that some models can perform calendar conversions, but even Japanese-centric models struggle with Japanese-calendar arithmetic and with maintaining consistency across calendars. Our results highlight the importance of developing LMs that are better equipped for culture-specific calendar understanding. | [🔗 Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04432v1) |

| [ChronoGraph: A Real-World Graph-Based Multivariate Time Series Dataset](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04449v1) | Adrian Catalin Lutu, Ioana Pintilie, Elena Burceanu, Andrei Manolache | 2025-09-04 | Model Evaluation, Training & Evaluation, Responsible AI | We present ChronoGraph, a graph-structured multivariate time series forecasting dataset built from real-world production microservices. Each node is a service that emits a multivariate stream of system-level performance metrics, capturing CPU, memory, and network usage patterns, while directed edges encode dependencies between services. The primary task is forecasting future values of these signals at the service level. In addition, ChronoGraph provides expert-annotated incident windows as anomaly labels, enabling evaluation of anomaly detection methods and assessment of forecast robustness during operational disruptions. Compared to existing benchmarks from industrial control systems or traffic and air-quality domains, ChronoGraph uniquely combines (i) multivariate time series, (ii) an explicit, machine-readable dependency graph, and (iii) anomaly labels aligned with real incidents. We report baseline results spanning forecasting models, pretrained time-series foundation models, and standard anomaly detectors. ChronoGraph offers a realistic benchmark for studying structure-aware forecasting and incident-aware evaluation in microservice systems. | [🔗 Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04449v1) |
| [Durian: Dual Reference-guided Portrait Animation with Attribute Transfer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04434v1) | Hyunsoo Cha, Byungjun Kim, Hanbyul Joo | 2025-09-04 | Model Evaluation, Prompt Engineering, Diffusion Models, Responsible AI, Multimodal AI | We present Durian, the first method for generating portrait animation videos with facial attribute transfer from a given reference image to a target portrait in a zero-shot manner. To enable high-fidelity and spatially consistent attribute transfer across frames, we introduce dual reference networks that inject spatial features from both the portrait and attribute images into the denoising process of a diffusion model. We train the model using a self-reconstruction formulation, where two frames are sampled from the same portrait video: one is treated as the attribute reference and the other as the target portrait, and the remaining frames are reconstructed conditioned on these inputs and their corresponding masks. To support the transfer of attributes with varying spatial extent, we propose a mask expansion strategy using keypoint-conditioned image generation for training. In addition, we further augment the attribute and portrait images with spatial and appearance-level transformations to improve robustness to positional misalignment between them. These strategies allow the model to effectively generalize across diverse attributes and in-the-wild reference combinations, despite being trained without explicit triplet supervision. Durian achieves state-of-the-art performance on portrait animation with attribute transfer, and notably, its dual reference design enables multi-attribute composition in a single generation pass without additional training. | [🔗 Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04434v1) |
| [Zero and Nonzero Energy Majorana Modes in an Extended Kitaev Chain](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04420v1) | Mohammad Ghuneim, Raditya Weda Bomantara | 2025-09-04 | Model Evaluation, Responsible AI | This paper studies an extended Kitaev chain with three sublattices per unit cell. This extended version is obtained by hybridizing a modified Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model featuring trimerized unit cells with the standard Kitaev chain, resulting in a hexamer structure on the Majorana basis. Due to the interplay between the sublattice configuration and the $p$-wave superconducting pairing, a rich structure of edge modes beyond the expected Majorana zero modes is obtained. The various Majorana edge modes are further found to demonstrate considerable robustness against some generic perturbations and disorder. The presence of robust Majorana edge modes beyond their zero energy variations potentially offers a step forward in the ongoing efforts to unambiguously detect Majorana modes in experiments. | [🔗 Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04420v1) |

These two types of data are typically used by approaches like Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), respectively. In this paper, we show that these approaches are not in contradiction, but are instances of a single optimization process. We derive a Unified Policy Gradient Estimator, and present the calculations of a wide spectrum of post-training approaches as the gradient of a common objective under different data distribution assumptions and various bias-variance tradeoffs. The gradient estimator is constructed with four interchangeable parts: stabilization mask, reference policy denominator, advantage estimate, and likelihood gradient. Motivated by our theoretical findings, we propose Hybrid Post-Training (HPT), an algorithm that dynamically selects different training signals. HPT is designed to yield both effective exploitation of demonstration and stable exploration without sacrificing learned reasoning patterns. We provide extensive experiments and ablation studies to verify the effectiveness of our unified theoretical framework and HPT. Across six mathematical reasoning benchmarks and two out-of-distribution suites, HPT consistently surpasses strong baselines across models of varying scales and families. | [🔗 Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04419v1) |
| [No Thoughts Just AI: Biased LLM Recommendations Limit Human Agency in
  Resume Screening](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04404v1) | Kyra Wilson, Mattea Sim, Anna-Maria Gueorguieva, Aylin Caliskan | 2025-09-04 | Model Evaluation, Training & Evaluation, Responsible AI | In this study, we conduct a resume-screening experiment (N=528) where people collaborate with simulated AI models exhibiting race-based preferences (bias) to evaluate candidates for 16 high and low status occupations. Simulated AI bias approximates factual and counterfactual estimates of racial bias in real-world AI systems. We investigate people's preferences for White, Black, Hispanic, and Asian candidates (represented through names and affinity groups on quality-controlled resumes) across 1,526 scenarios and measure their unconscious associations between race and status using implicit association tests (IATs), which predict discriminatory hiring decisions but have not been investigated in human-AI collaboration. When making decisions without AI or with AI that exhibits no race-based preferences, people select all candidates at equal rates. However, when interacting with AI favoring a particular group, people also favor those candidates up to 90% of the time, indicating a significant behavioral shift. The likelihood of selecting candidates whose identities do not align with common race-status stereotypes can increase by 13% if people complete an IAT before conducting resume screening. Finally, even if people think AI recommendations are low quality or not important, their decisions are still vulnerable to AI bias under certain circumstances. This work has implications for people's autonomy in AI-HITL scenarios, AI and work, design and evaluation of AI hiring systems, and strategies for mitigating bias in collaborative decision-making tasks. In particular, organizational and regulatory policy should acknowledge the complex nature of AI-HITL decision making when implementing these systems, educating people who use them, and determining which are subject to oversight. | [🔗 Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04404v1) |
| [Learning neural representations for X-ray ptychography reconstruction
  with unknown probes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04402v1) | Tingyou Li, Zixin Xu, Zirui Gao, Hanfei Yan, Xiaojing Huang, Jizhou Li | 2025-09-04 | Model Evaluation, Responsible AI | X-ray ptychography provides exceptional nanoscale resolution and is widely applied in materials science, biology, and nanotechnology. However, its full potential is constrained by the critical challenge of accurately reconstructing images when the illuminating probe is unknown. Conventional iterative methods and deep learning approaches are often suboptimal, particularly under the low-signal conditions inherent to low-dose and high-speed experiments. These limitations compromise reconstruction fidelity and restrict the broader adoption of the technique. In this work, we introduce the Ptychographic Implicit Neural Representation (PtyINR), a self-supervised framework that simultaneously addresses the object and probe recovery problem. By parameterizing both as continuous neural representations, PtyINR performs end-to-end reconstruction directly from raw diffraction patterns without requiring any pre-characterization of the probe.

| [Few-step Flow for 3D Generation via Marginal-Data Transport Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04406v1) | Zanwei Zhou, Taoran Yi, Jiemin Fang, Chen Yang, Lingxi Xie, Xinggang Wang, Wei Shen, Qi Tian | 2025-09-04 | Production and Deployment, LLM, Diffusion Models, Optimization | Flow-based 3D generation models typically require dozens of sampling steps during inference. Though few-step distillation methods, particularly Consistency Models (CMs), have achieved substantial advancements in accelerating 2D diffusion models, they remain under-explored for more complex 3D generation tasks. In this study, we propose a novel framework, MDT-dist, for few-step 3D flow distillation. Our approach is built upon a primary objective: distilling the pretrained model to learn the Marginal-Data Transport. Directly learning this objective needs to integrate the velocity fields, while this integral is intractable to be implemented. Therefore, we propose two optimizable objectives, Velocity Matching (VM) and Velocity Distillation (VD), to equivalently convert the optimization target from the transport level to the velocity and the distribution level respectively. Velocity Matching (VM) learns to stably match the velocity fields between the student and the teacher, but inevitably provides biased gradient estimates. Velocity Distillation (VD) further enhances the optimization process by leveraging the learned velocity fields to perform probability density distillation. When evaluated on the pioneer 3D generation framework TRELLIS, our method reduces sampling steps of each flow transformer from 25 to 1 or 2, achieving 0.68s (1 step x 2) and 0.94s (2 steps x 2) latency with 9.0x and 6.5x speedup on A800, while preserving high visual and geometric fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing CM distillation methods, and enables TRELLIS to achieve superior performance in few-step 3D generation. | [🔗 Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04406v1) |

However, navigating and understanding these models remains challenging due to inconsistent metadata and unstructured repositories. We introduce Delta Activations, a method to represent finetuned models as vector embeddings by measuring shifts in their internal activations relative to a base model. This representation allows for effective clustering by domain and task, revealing structure in the model landscape. Delta Activations also demonstrate desirable properties: it is robust across finetuning settings and exhibits an additive property when finetuning datasets are mixed. In addition, we show that Delta Activations can embed tasks via few-shot finetuning, and further explore its use for model selection and merging. We hope Delta Activations can facilitate the practice of reusing publicly available models.

| [Interpretable Clustering with Adaptive Heterogeneous Causal Structure
  Learning in Mixed Observational Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04415v1) | Wenrui Li, Qinghao Zhang, Xiaowo Wang | 2025-09-04 | AI Safety | Understanding causal heterogeneity is essential for scientific discovery in domains such as biology and medicine. However, existing methods lack causal awareness, with insufficient modeling of heterogeneity, confounding, and observational constraints, leading to poor interpretability and difficulty distinguishing true causal heterogeneity from spurious associations. We propose an unsupervised framework, HCL (Interpretable Causal Mechanism-Aware Clustering with Adaptive Heterogeneous Causal Structure Learning), that jointly infers latent clusters and their associated causal structures from mixed-type observational data without requiring temporal ordering, environment labels, interventions or other prior knowledge. HCL relaxes the homogeneity and sufficiency assumptions by introducing an equivalent representation that encodes both structural heterogeneity and confounding. It further develops a bi-directional iterative strategy to alternately refine causal clustering and structure learning, along with a self-supervised regularization that balance cross-cluster universality and specificity. Together, these components enable convergence toward interpretable, heterogeneous causal patterns. Theoretically, we show identifiability of heterogeneous causal structures under mild conditions. Empirically, HCL achieves superior performance in both clustering and structure learning tasks, and recovers biologically meaningful mechanisms in real-world single-cell perturbation data, demonstrating its utility for discovering interpretable, mechanism-level causal heterogeneity. | [🔗 Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04415v1) |

External memory is a natural way to persist these discoveries, and recent work has shown clear benefits for reasoning-intensive tasks. We see an opportunity to make such memories more broadly reusable and scalable by moving beyond instance-based memory entries (e.g. exact query/response pairs, or summaries tightly coupled with the original problem context) toward concept-level memory: reusable, modular abstractions distilled from solution traces and stored in natural language. For future queries, relevant concepts are selectively retrieved and integrated into the prompt, enabling test-time continual learning without weight updates. Our design introduces new strategies for abstracting takeaways from rollouts and retrieving entries for new queries, promoting reuse and allowing memory to expand with additional experiences. On the challenging ARC-AGI benchmark, our method yields a 7.5% relative gain over a strong no-memory baseline with performance continuing to scale with inference compute. We find abstract concepts to be the most consistent memory design, outscoring the baseline at all tested inference compute scales. Moreover, we confirm that dynamically updating memory during test-time outperforms an otherwise identical fixed memory setting with additional attempts, supporting the hypothesis that solving more problems and abstracting more patterns to memory enables further solutions in a form of self-improvement.

| [Zero modes and index theorems for non-Hermitian Dirac fermions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04447v1) | Bitan Roy | 2025-09-04 | General AI | Dirac fermions, subject to external magnetic fields and in the presence of mass orders that assume topologically nontrivial spatial textures such as domain-wall and vortices, for example, bind robust mid-gap states at zero-energy, the number of which is governed by the Aharonov-Casher and Jackiw-Rebbi or Jackiw-Rossi index theorems, respectively. Here I extend the jurisdiction of these prominent index theorems to Lorentz invariant non-Hermitian (NH) Dirac operators, constructed by augmenting the celebrated Dirac Hamiltonian by a masslike anti-Hermitian operator that also scales linearly with momentum. The resulting NH Dirac operator manifests real eigenvalues over an extended NH parameter regime, characterized by a real effective Fermi velocity for NH Dirac fermions. From the explicit solutions of the zero-energy bound states, I show that in the presence of external magnetic fields of arbitrary shape such modes always exist when the system encloses a finite number of magnetic flux quanta, while in the presence of spatially non-trivial textures of the mass orders localized zero-energy modes can only be found in the spectrum when the effective Fermi velocity for NH Dirac fermions is real. These findings pave a concrete route to realize nucleation of competing orders from the topologically robust zero-energy manifold in NH or open Dirac systems. Possible experimental setups to test these predictions are discussed. | [🔗 Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04447v1) |

We implement this paradigm in DEXOP, a passive hand exoskeleton designed to maximize human ability to collect rich sensory (vision + tactile) data for diverse dexterous manipulation tasks in natural environments. DEXOP mechanically connects human fingers to robot fingers, providing users with direct contact feedback (via proprioception) and mirrors the human hand pose to the passive robot hand to maximize the transfer of demonstrated skills to the robot. The force feedback and pose mirroring make task demonstrations more natural for humans compared to teleoperation, increasing both speed and accuracy. We evaluate DEXOP across a range of dexterous, contact-rich tasks, demonstrating its ability to collect high-quality demonstration data at scale. Policies learned with DEXOP data significantly improve task performance per unit time of data collection compared to teleoperation, making DEXOP a powerful tool for advancing robot dexterity.

  machine-learning interatomic potentials](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04440v1) | Igor Vorotnikov, Fedor Romashov, Nikita Rybin, Maxim Rakhuba, Ivan S. Novikov | 2025-09-04 | General AI | Machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) have become a mainstay in computationally-guided materials science, surpassing traditional force fields due to their flexible functional form and superior accuracy in reproducing physical properties of materials. This flexibility is achieved through mathematically-rigorous basis sets that describe interatomic interactions within a local atomic environment. The number of parameters in these basis sets influences both the size of the training dataset required and the computational speed of the MLIP. Consequently, compressing MLIPs by reducing the number of parameters is a promising route to more efficient simulations. In this work, we use low-rank matrix and tensor factorizations under fixed-rank constraints to achieve this compression. In addition, we demonstrate that an algorithm with automatic rank augmentation helps to find a deeper local minimum of the fitted potential. The methodology is verified using the Moment Tensor Potential (MTP) model and benchmarked on multi-component systems: a Mo-Nb-Ta-W medium-entropy alloy, molten LiF-NaF-KF, and a glycine molecular crystal. The proposed approach achieves up to 50% compression without any loss of MTP accuracy and can be applied to compress other MLIPs. | [🔗 Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04440v1) |

  Collimators via Hough Transform](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04437v1) | Benjamin El-Zein, Dominik Eckert, Andreas Fieselmann, Christopher Syben, Ludwig Ritschl, Steffen Kappler, Sebastian Stober | 2025-09-04 | General AI | Collimation in X-ray imaging restricts exposure to the region-of-interest (ROI) and minimizes the radiation dose applied to the patient. The detection of collimator shadows is an essential image-based preprocessing step in digital radiography posing a challenge when edges get obscured by scattered X-ray radiation. Regardless, the prior knowledge that collimation forms polygonal-shaped shadows is evident. For this reason, we introduce a deep learning-based segmentation that is inherently constrained to its geometry. We achieve this by incorporating a differentiable Hough transform-based network to detect the collimation borders and enhance its capability to extract the information about the ROI center. During inference, we combine the information of both tasks to enable the generation of refined, line-constrained segmentation masks. We demonstrate robust reconstruction of collimated regions achieving median Hausdorff distances of 4.3-5.0mm on diverse test sets of real Xray images. While this application involves at most four shadow borders, our method is not fundamentally limited by a specific number of edges. | [🔗 Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04437v1) |

We analyse the correlations between measurements performed by two experimenters, Alice (who measures $\mu^-$ spin) and Bob (who measures $\mu^+$ decay products). Remarkably, the observed correlations persist irrespective of whether Bob's muon decays before or after Alice's spin measurement. We further discuss different interpretations of the same empirical results depending on the observer's reference frame. The findings reinforce the viewpoint that the Copenhagen interpretation of measurement is a mathematical tool rather than a literal account of physical reality. | [🔗 Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04436v1) |
| [Cartesian Linearly Distributive Categories: Revisited](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04435v1) | Rose Kudzman-Blais, Jean-Simon Pacaud Lemay | 2025-09-04 | General AI | Linearly distributive categories (LDC) were introduced by Cockett and Seely to provide an alternative categorical semantics for multiplicative linear logic. In contrast to Barr's $\ast$-autonomous categories, LDCs take multiplicative conjunction and disjunction as primitive notions. Thus, a LDC is a category with two monoidal products that interact via linear distributors. A cartesian linearly distributive category (CLDC) is a LDC whose two monoidal products coincide with categorical products and coproducts. Initially, it was believed that CLDCs and distributive categories would coincide, but this was later found not to be the case. Consequently, the study on CLDCs was not pursued further at the time. With recent developments for and applications of LDCs, there has been renewed interest in CLDCs. This paper revisits CLDCs, demonstrating strong structural properties they all satisfy and investigating two key classes of examples: posetal distributive categories and semi-additive categories. Additionally, we re-examine a previously assumed class of CLDCs, the Kleisli categories of exception monads of distributive categories, and show that they are not, in fact, CLDCs. | [🔗 Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04435v1) |

To address this gap, our paper highlights the importance of the concept of data uncertainty for explaining the effectiveness of the recent tabular DL methods. In particular, we reveal that the success of many beneficial design choices in tabular DL, such as numerical feature embeddings, retrieval-augmented models and advanced ensembling strategies, can be largely attributed to their implicit mechanisms for managing high data uncertainty. By dissecting these mechanisms, we provide a unifying understanding of the recent performance improvements. Furthermore, the insights derived from this data-uncertainty perspective directly allowed us to develop more effective numerical feature embeddings as an immediate practical outcome of our analysis. Overall, our work paves the way to foundational understanding of the benefits introduced by modern tabular methods that results in the concrete advancements of existing techniques and outlines future research directions for tabular DL. | [🔗 Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04430v1) |

  cluster calculation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04429v1) | Gregory H. Jones, Kaila E. Weflen, Jan M. L. Martin | 2025-09-04 | General AI | We propose two new diagnostics for the degree to which static correlation impacts the quality of a coupled cluster calculation. The first is the change in the Matito static correlation diagnostic $\overline{I_{ND}}$ between CCSD and CCSD(T), $\Delta I_{ND}[\textrm{(T)}]=\overline{I_{ND}}[\textrm{CCSD(T)}]-\overline{I_{ND}}[\textrm{CCSD}]$. The second is the ratio of the same and of the corresponding change in the total correlation diagnostic $\overline{I_{T}}=\overline{I_{ND}}+\overline{I_{D}}$, i.e., $r_I[(T)]=\Delta I_{ND}[\textrm{(T)}]/\Delta I_{T}[\textrm{(T)}]$. The first diagnostic can be extended to higher-order improvements in the wave function, e.g., $\Delta I_{ND}[\textrm{(Q)}]=\overline{I_{ND}}[\textrm{CCSDT(Q)}]-\overline{I_{ND}}[\textrm{CCSDT}]$. In general, a small $\Delta I_{ND}$[\textrm{level$_1$}] value indicates that at this level$_1$ of theory, the density is converged and any further changes to the energy come from dynamical correlation, while larger $\Delta I_{ND}$[\textrm{level$_2$}] indicates that the density is still not converged at level$_2$ and some static correlation remains. $r_I[(T)]$ is found to be a moderately good predictor for the importance of post-CCSD(T) correlation effects. | [🔗 Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04429v1) |

The main idea is to generalize the analysis of such systems: we first establish several hypotheses on the nonlinearities and prove their implications. These implications are then used to establish a local well-posedness result in $H^2(\mathbb{R}^d)$ and and to prove the existence of ground state solutions. Using a virial argument, we demonstrate a blow-up result for initial data with negative energy or with kinetic energy exceeding that of the ground state. Finally, employing the concentration-compactness/rigidity method, we prove a scattering result for solutions whose energy and kinetic energy are below those of the ground state. | [🔗 Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04428v1) |

In this work, we exploit these two features to introduce Kerr generating functions, which describe the scattering of any probe on a Kerr black hole background to all loop orders. These generating functions can be used to perform the tensor reduction of multi-loop integrands simply by differentiation with respect to the spin. As a first application of the Kerr generating functions, we study a neutron star in a Kerr black hole background. We organize the integrand by the helicity configuration of the exchanged gravitons and provide compact all-loop-order results for several helicity sectors and a full four-loop $\mathcal{O}(G^5)$ result. | [🔗 Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04425v1) |

This paper presents the design and development of a Blood Donation Web Platform, a web-based system that connects patients, donors, and administrators within a centralized digital space. The platform allows interested donors to register their personal information, including blood group, contact details, and availability. Patients can search for donors based on blood group and location, and the system provides a list of nearby donors who are ready to donate. The platform design was guided by use case, database, class, and sequence diagrams to ensure a well-structured and efficient system architecture. Modern web technologies, including PHP (Laravel framework), HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and MySQL, supported by XAMPP and Visual Studio Code, were employed to implement a dynamic, interactive, and user-friendly platform. By streamlining donor refgistration, blood requests, and communication, the proposed system reduces delays and complexities in emergencies, improving timely accessibility of blood and enhancing overall efficiency in blood donation services. | [🔗 Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04423v1) |

Stancil, Nhut Truong, Shutaro Ueda, Benjamin Vigneron, Congyao Zhang, John ZuHone | 2025-09-04 | General AI | Galaxy clusters, the Universe's largest halo structures, are filled with 10-100 million degree X-ray-emitting gas. Their evolution is shaped by energetic processes such as feedback from supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and mergers with other cosmic structures. The imprints of these processes on gas kinematic properties remain largely unknown, restricting our understanding of gas thermodynamics and energy conversion within clusters. High-resolution spectral mapping across a broad spatial-scale range provides a promising solution to this challenge, enabled by the recent launch of the XRISM X-ray Observatory. Here, we present the kinematic measurements of the X-ray-brightest Perseus cluster with XRISM, radially covering the extent of its cool core. We find direct evidence for the presence of at least two dominant drivers of gas motions operating on distinct physical scales: a small-scale driver in the inner ~60 kpc, likely associated with the SMBH feedback; and a large-scale driver in the outer core, powered by mergers. The inner driver sustains a heating rate at least an order of magnitude higher than the outer one. This finding suggests that, during the active phase, the SMBH feedback generates turbulence, which, if fully dissipated into heat, could play a significant role in offsetting radiative cooling losses in the Perseus core. Our study underscores the necessity of kinematic mapping observations of extended sources for robust conclusions on the properties of the velocity field and their role in the assembly and evolution of massive halos. It further offers a kinematic diagnostic for theoretical models of SMBH feedback. | [🔗 Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04421v1) |

  wetting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04418v1) | Alessio Squarcini, José M. Romero-Enrique, Andrew O. Parry | 2025-09-04 | General AI | We provide comprehensive details of how a previously overlooked entropic, or low temperature Casimir contribution, $W_C$, to the total binding potential for 3D short-ranged wetting may be determined from a microscopic Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson Hamiltonian. The entropic contribution comes from the many microscopic configurations corresponding to a given interfacial one, which arise from bulk-like fluctuations about the mean-field (MF) constrained profile, and adds to the usual MF contribution $W_{MF}$. We determine the functional dependence of $W_C$ on the interface (and wall) shape using a boundary integral method which can be cast as a diagrammatic expansion with each diagram corresponding to successively higher-order exponentially decaying contributions. The decay of $W_C$ is qualitatively different for first-order and critical wetting with the change in form occurring at the MF tricritical point. Including the Casimir contribution to the binding potential preserves the global surface phase diagram but changes, radically, predictions for fluctuation effects at first-order and tricritical wetting, even when capillary-wave fluctuations are not considered. | [🔗 Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04418v1) |
| [Dual spaces of lattices and semidistributive lattices](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04417v1) | Andrew Craig, Miroslav Haviar, Jose Sao Joao | 2025-09-04 | General AI | Birkhoff's 1937 dual representation of finite distributive lattices via finite posets was in 1970 extended to a dual representation of arbitrary distributive lattices via compact totally order-disconnected topological spaces by Priestley. This result enabled the development of natural duality theory in the 1980s by Davey and Werner, later on also in collaboration with Clark and Priestley.   In 1978 Urquhart extended Priestley's representation to general lattices via compact doubly quasi-ordered topological spaces (L-spaces). In 1995 Plo\v{s}\v{c}ica presented Urquhart's representation in the spirit of natural duality theory, by replacing on the dual side, Urquhart's two quasiorders by a digraph relation generalising Priestley's order relation.   In this paper we translate, following the spirit of natural duality theory, Urquhart's L-spaces into newly introduced Plo\v{s}\v{c}ica spaces. We then prove that every Plo\v{s}\v{c}ica space is the dual space of some general lattice. Based on the authors' 2022 characterisation of finite join and meet semidistributive lattices via their dual digraphs, we characterise general (possibly infinite) join and meet semidistributive lattices via their dual digraphs. Our results are illustrated by examples. | [🔗 Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04417v1) |
| [Entire conformal curves are affine or have super-Euclidean energy growth](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04414v1) | Toni Ikonen | 2025-09-04 | General AI | We prove that entire conformal curves $\mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^m$ fall into two classes: either the curve is affine or the average energy in a ball is strictly increasing for large radii and diverges to infinity. This rigidity follows from a blow-down argument and the strong interaction of the generalized Cauchy--Riemann equations with calibrated geometries and the sharp isoperimetric inequality for integral currents due to Almgren. As an application, we prove that every entire Lipschitz conformal curve is affine. This can be considered a higher-dimensional analog of the statement that an entire holomorphic function with a bounded complex differential is affine.   We also recall that a certain punctured cone over a Legendrian torus provides a submanifold in $\mathbb{R}^n$, for $n \geq 3$, for which an entire conformal curve yields a conformal covering map. As a related result, we prove that if a non-constant entire conformal curve factors through an $n$-dimensional submanifold, then the submanifold is calibrated and conformally equivalent to a flat non-compact quotient of $\mathbb{R}^n$. | [🔗 Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04414v1) |

  and MoTe$_2$](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04411v1) | J. Jobst, E. E. Krasovskii, R. Ribeiro, T. A. de Jong, C. R. Dean, R. M. Tromp, S. J. van der Molen | 2025-09-04 | General AI | We present angle-resolved reflected electron spectroscopy (ARRES) data for the three molybdenum-based transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) \mos, \mose, and \mote. To follow the changes as the series moves from S to Se to Te in more detail, we determine accurate IV-spectra for monolayers and bulk TMDs. These experimental data sets are then compared with theoretical predictions for both the unoccupied band structure and the scattering density of states. We find good agreement, especially for lower energies where inelastic effects are relatively unimportant. Furthermore, we identify a series of interlayer resonances for which the dependence of the hybridization effects on the layer count is observed. Although these resonances bear similarity to interlayer resonances in hBN and graphene, they differ in their character, being dominated by unoccupied $d$-states of the chalcogen-atoms. The unoccupied states studied and analyzed here play a key role in all processes that require an electron to temporarily reside in a state above the vacuum level, such as in photoemission and secondary electron emission experiments. | [🔗 Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04411v1) |
| [Infinite temperature at zero energy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04410v1) | Matteo Ippoliti, David M. Long | 2025-09-04 | General AI | We construct a family of static, geometrically local Hamiltonians that inherit eigenstate properties of periodically-driven (Floquet) systems. Our construction is a variation of the Feynman-Kitaev clock -- a well-known mapping between quantum circuits and local Hamiltonians -- where the clock register is given periodic boundary conditions. Assuming the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) holds for the input circuit, our construction yields Hamiltonians whose eigenstates have properties characteristic of infinite temperature, like volume-law entanglement entropy, across the whole spectrum -- including the ground state. We then construct a family of exactly solvable Floquet quantum circuits whose eigenstates are shown to obey the ETH at infinite temperature. Combining the two constructions yields a new family of local Hamiltonians with provably volume-law-entangled ground states, and the first such construction where the volume law holds for all contiguous subsystems. | [🔗 Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04410v1) |
| [An Arbitrary-Order Moving-Mesh Finite Element Algorithm for
  One-Dimensional Implicit Moving Boundary Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04409v1) | Matthew E Hubbard, Thomas J Radley | 2025-09-04 | General AI | We present a one-dimensional high-order moving-mesh finite element method for moving boundary problems where the boundary velocity depends implicitly on the solution in the interior of the domain. The method employs a conservative arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian approach to predict the evolution of the approximate solution. It retains the order of accuracy of the underlying fixed-mesh method by (i) computing the boundary velocities using a high-order approximation to a distributed local conservation principle which generates a Lagrangian `flow' velocity and (ii) assuming a continuous piecewise linear variation of the mesh velocity field in the interior of the computational domain.   Within each time-step the algorithm consists of two stages: the computation of a velocity field with which to move both the domain boundary and the internal mesh, and the approximation of the solution to the PDE on the updated mesh. Both internal and boundary velocities are generated within the same framework, though it would be simple to replace the internal mesh velocity field by applying a more traditional mesh movement strategy (for example, one which seeks to equidistribute an error indicator at each time-step): the high-order accuracy should be retained as long the discrete velocity which is used in the solution update is assumed to vary linearly within mesh elements. The proposed method is explicit in time, requires only the inversion of linear systems of equations within each time-step, and is implemented fully in the physical domain, so no mapping to a reference domain is employed. It attains arbitrary-order accuracy in both space and time without the need to satisfy a discrete geometric conservation law. | [🔗 Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04409v1) |
| [Chiral Graviton Theory of Fractional Quantum Hall States](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04408v1) | Yi-Hsien Du | 2025-09-04 | General AI | Recent polarized Raman scattering experiments indicate that fractional quantum Hall systems host a chiral spin-2 neutral collective mode, the long-wavelength limit of the magnetoroton, which behaves as a condensed-matter graviton. We present a nonlinear, gauge-invariant effective theory by gauging area-preserving diffeomorphisms (APDs) with a unimodular spatial metric as the gauge field. A Stueckelberg construction introduces an APD-invariant local potential that aligns the dynamical metric with a reference geometry, opening a tunable gap while preserving gauge redundancy. Together with a geometric Maxwell kinetic sector and the Wen-Zee and gravitational Chern-Simons terms, the theory yields a gapped chiral spin-2 excitation consistent with universal long-wavelength constraints. The tunable gap emerges naturally from symmetry and provides a route to an isotropic-nematic quantum critical point where the spin-2 mode softens. We further establish a linear dictionary to quadrupolar deformations in composite Fermi liquid bosonization, and outline applications to fractional Chern insulators as well as higher-dimensional generalizations. Finally, the approach can be extended to non-Abelian fractional quantum Hall states, capturing both spin-2 and spin-3/2 neutral modes. | [🔗 Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04408v1) |

The distribution of the magnetic field and the force acting on the wires are calculated under several typical setups, including the continuum limit. | [🔗 Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04407v1) |
| [Generation of Lognormal Synthetic Lyman-$α$ Forest Spectra for
  $P_{1D}$ Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04405v1) | Meagan Herbold, Naim Göksel Karaçaylı, Paul Martini | 2025-09-04 | General AI | The one-dimensional flux power spectrum (P1D) of the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest probes small-scale structure in the intergalactic medium (IGM) and is therefore sensitive to a variety of cosmological and astrophysical parameters. These include the amplitude and shape of the matter power spectrum, the thermal history of the IGM, the sum of neutrino masses, and potential small-scale fluctuations due to the nature of dark matter. However, P1D is also highly sensitive to observational and instrumental systematics, making accurate synthetic spectra essential for validating analyses and quantifying these effects, especially in high-volume surveys like the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). We present an efficient lognormal mock framework for generating one-dimensional Lyman-$\alpha$ forest spectra tailored for P1D analysis. Our method captures the redshift evolution of the mean transmitted flux and the scale-dependent shape and amplitude of the one-dimensional flux power spectrum by tuning Gaussian field correlations and transformation parameters. Across the DESI Early Data Release (EDR) redshift range ($2.0 \leq z \leq 3.8$), and a wide range of scales ($10^{-4}$ s km$^{-1} \leq k \leq 1.0$ s km$^{-1}$), our mocks recover the mean flux evolution with redshift to sub-percent accuracy, and the P1D at the percent level. Additionally, we discuss potential extensions of this framework, such as the incorporation of astrophysical contaminants, continuum uncertainties, and instrumental effects. Such improvements would expand its utility in ongoing and upcoming surveys and enable a broader range of validation efforts and systematics studies for P1D inference and precision cosmology. | [🔗 Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04405v1) |
| [Monte Carlo simulation of random circuit sampling in quantum computing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04401v1) | Andreas Raab | 2025-09-04 | General AI | We develop Monte Carlo methods for sampling random states and corresponding bit strings in qubit systems. To this end, we derive exact probability density functions that yield the Porter-Thomas distribution in the limit of large systems. We apply these functions in importance sampling algorithms and demonstrate efficiency for qubit systems with 70, 105, 1000, and more than one million ($2^{20}$) qubits. In particular, we simulate the output of recent quantum computations without noise on a PC with minimal computational cost. I would therefore argue that random circuit sampling can be conveniently performed on classical computers. | [🔗 Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04401v1) |
