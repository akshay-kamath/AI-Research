| [Towards a Deeper Understanding of Reasoning Capabilities in Large
  Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10543v1) | Annie Wong, Thomas Bäck, Aske Plaat, Niki van Stein, Anna V. Kononova | 2025-05-15 | LLM | While large language models demonstrate impressive performance on static benchmarks, the true potential of large language models as self-learning and reasoning agents in dynamic environments remains unclear. This study systematically evaluates the efficacy of self-reflection, heuristic mutation, and planning as prompting techniques to test the adaptive capabilities of agents. We conduct experiments with various open-source language models in dynamic environments and find that larger models generally outperform smaller ones, but that strategic prompting can close this performance gap. Second, a too-long prompt can negatively impact smaller models on basic reactive tasks, while larger models show more robust behaviour. Third, advanced prompting techniques primarily benefit smaller models on complex games, but offer less improvement for already high-performing large language models. Yet, we find that advanced reasoning methods yield highly variable outcomes: while capable of significantly improving performance when reasoning and decision-making align, they also introduce instability and can lead to big performance drops. Compared to human performance, our findings reveal little evidence of true emergent reasoning. Instead, large language model performance exhibits persistent limitations in crucial areas such as planning, reasoning, and spatial coordination, suggesting that current-generation large language models still suffer fundamental shortcomings that may not be fully overcome through self-reflective prompting alone. Reasoning is a multi-faceted task, and while reasoning methods like Chain of thought improves multi-step reasoning on math word problems, our findings using dynamic benchmarks highlight important shortcomings in general reasoning capabilities, indicating a need to move beyond static benchmarks to capture the complexity of reasoning. | [🔗 Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10543v1) |

| [Computational screening and experimental validation of promising
  Wadsley-Roth Niobates](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10549v1) | Zachary J. L. Bare, CJ Sturgill, Manish Kumar, Iva Milisavljevic, Hans-Conrad zur Loye, Scott Misture, Morgan Stefik, Christopher Sutton | 2025-05-15 | Diffusion Models | The growing demand for efficient, high-capacity energy storage systems has driven extensive research into advanced materials for lithium-ion batteries. Among the various candidates, Wadsley-Roth (WR) niobates have emerged as a promising class of materials for fast Li+ storage due to rapid ion diffusion within their ReO3-like blocks in combination with good electronic conductivity along the shear planes. Despite the remarkable features of WR phases, there are presently less than 30 known structures which limits identification of structure-property relationships for improved performance as well as the identification of phases with more earth-abundant elements. In this work, we have dramatically expanded the set of potentially (meta)stable compositions (with $\Delta$ Hd < 22 meV/atom) to 1301 (out of 3283) through high-throughput screening with density functional theory (DFT). This large space of compound was generated through single- and double-site substitution into 10 known WR-niobate prototypes using 48 elements across the periodic table. To confirm the structure predictions, we successfully synthesized and validated with X-ray diffraction a new material, MoWNb24O66. The measured lithium diffusivity in MoWNb24O66 has a peak value of 1.0x10-16 m2/s at 1.45 V vs. Li/Li+ and achieved 225 mAh/g at 5C. Thus a computationally predicted phase was realized experimentally with performance exceeding Nb16W5O55, a recent WR benchmark. Overall, the computational dataset of potentially stable novel compounds and with one realized that has competitive performance provide a valuable guide for experimentalists in discovering new durable battery materials. | [🔗 Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10549v1) |
| [Pharmacophore-Conditioned Diffusion Model for Ligand-Based De Novo Drug
  Design](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10545v1) | Amira Alakhdar, Barnabas Poczos, Newell Washburn | 2025-05-15 | Diffusion Models, LLM | Developing bioactive molecules remains a central, time- and cost-heavy challenge in drug discovery, particularly for novel targets lacking structural or functional data. Pharmacophore modeling presents an alternative for capturing the key features required for molecular bioactivity against a biological target. In this work, we present PharmaDiff, a pharmacophore-conditioned diffusion model for 3D molecular generation. PharmaDiff employs a transformer-based architecture to integrate an atom-based representation of the 3D pharmacophore into the generative process, enabling the precise generation of 3D molecular graphs that align with predefined pharmacophore hypotheses. Through comprehensive testing, PharmaDiff demonstrates superior performance in matching 3D pharmacophore constraints compared to ligand-based drug design methods. Additionally, it achieves higher docking scores across a range of proteins in structure-based drug design, without the need for target protein structures. By integrating pharmacophore modeling with 3D generative techniques, PharmaDiff offers a powerful and flexible framework for rational drug design. | [🔗 Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10545v1) |

| [Depth Anything with Any Prior](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10565v1) | Zehan Wang, Siyu Chen, Lihe Yang, Jialei Wang, Ziang Zhang, Hengshuang Zhao, Zhou Zhao | 2025-05-15 | RLHF, Prompt Engineering | This work presents Prior Depth Anything, a framework that combines incomplete but precise metric information in depth measurement with relative but complete geometric structures in depth prediction, generating accurate, dense, and detailed metric depth maps for any scene. To this end, we design a coarse-to-fine pipeline to progressively integrate the two complementary depth sources. First, we introduce pixel-level metric alignment and distance-aware weighting to pre-fill diverse metric priors by explicitly using depth prediction. It effectively narrows the domain gap between prior patterns, enhancing generalization across varying scenarios. Second, we develop a conditioned monocular depth estimation (MDE) model to refine the inherent noise of depth priors. By conditioning on the normalized pre-filled prior and prediction, the model further implicitly merges the two complementary depth sources. Our model showcases impressive zero-shot generalization across depth completion, super-resolution, and inpainting over 7 real-world datasets, matching or even surpassing previous task-specific methods. More importantly, it performs well on challenging, unseen mixed priors and enables test-time improvements by switching prediction models, providing a flexible accuracy-efficiency trade-off while evolving with advancements in MDE models. | [🔗 Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10565v1) |
| [MathCoder-VL: Bridging Vision and Code for Enhanced Multimodal
  Mathematical Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10557v1) | Ke Wang, Junting Pan, Linda Wei, Aojun Zhou, Weikang Shi, Zimu Lu, Han Xiao, Yunqiao Yang, Houxing Ren, Mingjie Zhan, Hongsheng Li | 2025-05-15 | RLHF, Multimodal AI, Optimization, LLM | Natural language image-caption datasets, widely used for training Large Multimodal Models, mainly focus on natural scenarios and overlook the intricate details of mathematical figures that are critical for problem-solving, hindering the advancement of current LMMs in multimodal mathematical reasoning. To this end, we propose leveraging code as supervision for cross-modal alignment, since code inherently encodes all information needed to generate corresponding figures, establishing a precise connection between the two modalities. Specifically, we co-develop our image-to-code model and dataset with model-in-the-loop approach, resulting in an image-to-code model, FigCodifier and ImgCode-8.6M dataset, the largest image-code dataset to date. Furthermore, we utilize FigCodifier to synthesize novel mathematical figures and then construct MM-MathInstruct-3M, a high-quality multimodal math instruction fine-tuning dataset. Finally, we present MathCoder-VL, trained with ImgCode-8.6M for cross-modal alignment and subsequently fine-tuned on MM-MathInstruct-3M for multimodal math problem solving. Our model achieves a new open-source SOTA across all six metrics. Notably, it surpasses GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet in the geometry problem-solving subset of MathVista, achieving improvements of 8.9% and 9.2%. The dataset and models will be released at https://github.com/mathllm/MathCoder. | [🔗 Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10557v1) |
| [Beyond 'Aha!': Toward Systematic Meta-Abilities Alignment in Large
  Reasoning Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10554v1) | Zhiyuan Hu, Yibo Wang, Hanze Dong, Yuhui Xu, Amrita Saha, Caiming Xiong, Bryan Hooi, Junnan Li | 2025-05-15 | RLHF, Prompt Engineering | Large reasoning models (LRMs) already possess a latent capacity for long chain-of-thought reasoning. Prior work has shown that outcome-based reinforcement learning (RL) can incidentally elicit advanced reasoning behaviors such as self-correction, backtracking, and verification phenomena often referred to as the model's "aha moment". However, the timing and consistency of these emergent behaviors remain unpredictable and uncontrollable, limiting the scalability and reliability of LRMs' reasoning capabilities. To address these limitations, we move beyond reliance on prompts and coincidental "aha moments". Instead, we explicitly align models with three meta-abilities: deduction, induction, and abduction, using automatically generated, self-verifiable tasks. Our three stage-pipeline individual alignment, parameter-space merging, and domain-specific reinforcement learning, boosting performance by over 10\% relative to instruction-tuned baselines. Furthermore, domain-specific RL from the aligned checkpoint yields an additional 2\% average gain in the performance ceiling across math, coding, and science benchmarks, demonstrating that explicit meta-ability alignment offers a scalable and dependable foundation for reasoning.

| [WorldPM: Scaling Human Preference Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10527v1) | Binghai Wang, Runji Lin, Keming Lu, Le Yu, Zhenru Zhang, Fei Huang, Chujie Zheng, Kai Dang, Yang Fan, Xingzhang Ren, An Yang, Binyuan Hui, Dayiheng Liu, Tao Gui, Qi Zhang, Xuanjing Huang, Yu-Gang Jiang, Bowen Yu, Jingren Zhou, Junyang Lin | 2025-05-15 | RLHF, Scaling Laws, Optimization, Training & Evaluation | Motivated by scaling laws in language modeling that demonstrate how test loss scales as a power law with model and dataset sizes, we find that similar laws exist in preference modeling. We propose World Preference Modeling$ (WorldPM) to emphasize this scaling potential, where World Preference embodies a unified representation of human preferences. In this paper, we collect preference data from public forums covering diverse user communities, and conduct extensive training using 15M-scale data across models ranging from 1.5B to 72B parameters. We observe distinct patterns across different evaluation metrics: (1) Adversarial metrics (ability to identify deceptive features) consistently scale up with increased training data and base model size; (2) Objective metrics (objective knowledge with well-defined answers) show emergent behavior in larger language models, highlighting WorldPM's scalability potential; (3) Subjective metrics (subjective preferences from a limited number of humans or AI) do not demonstrate scaling trends. Further experiments validate the effectiveness of WorldPM as a foundation for preference fine-tuning. Through evaluations on 7 benchmarks with 20 subtasks, we find that WorldPM broadly improves the generalization performance across human preference datasets of varying sizes (7K, 100K and 800K samples), with performance gains exceeding 5% on many key subtasks. Integrating WorldPM into our internal RLHF pipeline, we observe significant improvements on both in-house and public evaluation sets, with notable gains of 4% to 8% in our in-house evaluations. | [🔗 Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10527v1) |
| [Knowledge capture, adaptation and composition (KCAC): A framework for
  cross-task curriculum learning in robotic manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10522v1) | Xinrui Wang, Yan Jin | 2025-05-15 | RLHF, AI Safety, Training & Evaluation | Reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated remarkable potential in robotic manipulation but faces challenges in sample inefficiency and lack of interpretability, limiting its applicability in real world scenarios. Enabling the agent to gain a deeper understanding and adapt more efficiently to diverse working scenarios is crucial, and strategic knowledge utilization is a key factor in this process. This paper proposes a Knowledge Capture, Adaptation, and Composition (KCAC) framework to systematically integrate knowledge transfer into RL through cross-task curriculum learning. KCAC is evaluated using a two block stacking task in the CausalWorld benchmark, a complex robotic manipulation environment. To our knowledge, existing RL approaches fail to solve this task effectively, reflecting deficiencies in knowledge capture. In this work, we redesign the benchmark reward function by removing rigid constraints and strict ordering, allowing the agent to maximize total rewards concurrently and enabling flexible task completion. Furthermore, we define two self-designed sub-tasks and implement a structured cross-task curriculum to facilitate efficient learning. As a result, our KCAC approach achieves a 40 percent reduction in training time while improving task success rates by 10 percent compared to traditional RL methods. Through extensive evaluation, we identify key curriculum design parameters subtask selection, transition timing, and learning rate that optimize learning efficiency and provide conceptual guidance for curriculum based RL frameworks. This work offers valuable insights into curriculum design in RL and robotic learning. | [🔗 Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10522v1) |

| [3D-Fixup: Advancing Photo Editing with 3D Priors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10566v1) | Yen-Chi Cheng, Krishna Kumar Singh, Jae Shin Yoon, Alex Schwing, Liangyan Gui, Matheus Gadelha, Paul Guerrero, Nanxuan Zhao | 2025-05-15 | Multimodal AI, Diffusion Models | Despite significant advances in modeling image priors via diffusion models, 3D-aware image editing remains challenging, in part because the object is only specified via a single image. To tackle this challenge, we propose 3D-Fixup, a new framework for editing 2D images guided by learned 3D priors. The framework supports difficult editing situations such as object translation and 3D rotation. To achieve this, we leverage a training-based approach that harnesses the generative power of diffusion models. As video data naturally encodes real-world physical dynamics, we turn to video data for generating training data pairs, i.e., a source and a target frame. Rather than relying solely on a single trained model to infer transformations between source and target frames, we incorporate 3D guidance from an Image-to-3D model, which bridges this challenging task by explicitly projecting 2D information into 3D space. We design a data generation pipeline to ensure high-quality 3D guidance throughout training. Results show that by integrating these 3D priors, 3D-Fixup effectively supports complex, identity coherent 3D-aware edits, achieving high-quality results and advancing the application of diffusion models in realistic image manipulation.

| [T2A-Feedback: Improving Basic Capabilities of Text-to-Audio Generation
  via Fine-grained AI Feedback](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10561v1) | Zehan Wang, Ke Lei, Chen Zhu, Jiawei Huang, Sashuai Zhou, Luping Liu, Xize Cheng, Shengpeng Ji, Zhenhui Ye, Tao Jin, Zhou Zhao | 2025-05-15 | Multimodal AI, Training & Evaluation | Text-to-audio (T2A) generation has achieved remarkable progress in generating a variety of audio outputs from language prompts. However, current state-of-the-art T2A models still struggle to satisfy human preferences for prompt-following and acoustic quality when generating complex multi-event audio. To improve the performance of the model in these high-level applications, we propose to enhance the basic capabilities of the model with AI feedback learning. First, we introduce fine-grained AI audio scoring pipelines to: 1) verify whether each event in the text prompt is present in the audio (Event Occurrence Score), 2) detect deviations in event sequences from the language description (Event Sequence Score), and 3) assess the overall acoustic and harmonic quality of the generated audio (Acoustic&Harmonic Quality). We evaluate these three automatic scoring pipelines and find that they correlate significantly better with human preferences than other evaluation metrics. This highlights their value as both feedback signals and evaluation metrics. Utilizing our robust scoring pipelines, we construct a large audio preference dataset, T2A-FeedBack, which contains 41k prompts and 249k audios, each accompanied by detailed scores. Moreover, we introduce T2A-EpicBench, a benchmark that focuses on long captions, multi-events, and story-telling scenarios, aiming to evaluate the advanced capabilities of T2A models. Finally, we demonstrate how T2A-FeedBack can enhance current state-of-the-art audio model. With simple preference tuning, the audio generation model exhibits significant improvements in both simple (AudioCaps test set) and complex (T2A-EpicBench) scenarios. | [🔗 Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10561v1) |
| [Exploring Implicit Visual Misunderstandings in Multimodal Large Language
  Models through Attention Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10541v1) | Pengfei Wang, Guohai Xu, Weinong Wang, Junjie Yang, Jie Lou, Yunhua Xue | 2025-05-15 | Multimodal AI | Recent advancements have enhanced the capability of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to comprehend multi-image information. However, existing benchmarks primarily evaluate answer correctness, overlooking whether models genuinely comprehend the visual input. To address this, we define implicit visual misunderstanding (IVM), where MLLMs provide correct answers without fully comprehending the visual input. Through our analysis, we decouple the visual and textual modalities within the causal attention module, revealing that attention distribution increasingly converges on the image associated with the correct answer as the network layers deepen. This insight leads to the introduction of a scale-agnostic metric, \textit{attention accuracy}, and a novel benchmark for quantifying IVMs. Attention accuracy directly evaluates the model's visual understanding via internal mechanisms, remaining robust to positional biases for more reliable assessments. Furthermore, we extend our approach to finer granularities and demonstrate its effectiveness in unimodal scenarios, underscoring its versatility and generalizability. | [🔗 Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10541v1) |
| [Enhancing Multi-Image Question Answering via Submodular Subset Selection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10533v1) | Aaryan Sharma, Shivansh Gupta, Samar Agarwal, Vishak Prasad C., Ganesh Ramakrishnan | 2025-05-15 | Multimodal AI | Large multimodal models (LMMs) have achieved high performance in vision-language tasks involving single image but they struggle when presented with a collection of multiple images (Multiple Image Question Answering scenario). These tasks, which involve reasoning over large number of images, present issues in scalability (with increasing number of images) and retrieval performance. In this work, we propose an enhancement for retriever framework introduced in MIRAGE model using submodular subset selection techniques. Our method leverages query-aware submodular functions, such as GraphCut, to pre-select a subset of semantically relevant images before main retrieval component. We demonstrate that using anchor-based queries and augmenting the data improves submodular-retriever pipeline effectiveness, particularly in large haystack sizes. | [🔗 Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10533v1) |

| [End-to-End Vision Tokenizer Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10562v1) | Wenxuan Wang, Fan Zhang, Yufeng Cui, Haiwen Diao, Zhuoyan Luo, Huchuan Lu, Jing Liu, Xinlong Wang | 2025-05-15 | Optimization, Multimodal AI, Diffusion Models | Existing vision tokenization isolates the optimization of vision tokenizers from downstream training, implicitly assuming the visual tokens can generalize well across various tasks, e.g., image generation and visual question answering. The vision tokenizer optimized for low-level reconstruction is agnostic to downstream tasks requiring varied representations and semantics. This decoupled paradigm introduces a critical misalignment: The loss of the vision tokenization can be the representation bottleneck for target tasks. For example, errors in tokenizing text in a given image lead to poor results when recognizing or generating them. To address this, we propose ETT, an end-to-end vision tokenizer tuning approach that enables joint optimization between vision tokenization and target autoregressive tasks. Unlike prior autoregressive models that use only discrete indices from a frozen vision tokenizer, ETT leverages the visual embeddings of the tokenizer codebook, and optimizes the vision tokenizers end-to-end with both reconstruction and caption objectives. ETT can be seamlessly integrated into existing training pipelines with minimal architecture modifications. Our ETT is simple to implement and integrate, without the need to adjust the original codebooks or architectures of the employed large language models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed end-to-end vision tokenizer tuning unlocks significant performance gains, i.e., 2-6% for multimodal understanding and visual generation tasks compared to frozen tokenizer baselines, while preserving the original reconstruction capability. We hope this very simple and strong method can empower multimodal foundation models besides image generation and understanding. | [🔗 Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10562v1) |
| [Style Customization of Text-to-Vector Generation with Image Diffusion
  Priors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10558v1) | Peiying Zhang, Nanxuan Zhao, Jing Liao | 2025-05-15 | Optimization, Diffusion Models | Scalable Vector Graphics (SVGs) are highly favored by designers due to their resolution independence and well-organized layer structure. Although existing text-to-vector (T2V) generation methods can create SVGs from text prompts, they often overlook an important need in practical applications: style customization, which is vital for producing a collection of vector graphics with consistent visual appearance and coherent aesthetics. Extending existing T2V methods for style customization poses certain challenges. Optimization-based T2V models can utilize the priors of text-to-image (T2I) models for customization, but struggle with maintaining structural regularity. On the other hand, feed-forward T2V models can ensure structural regularity, yet they encounter difficulties in disentangling content and style due to limited SVG training data.   To address these challenges, we propose a novel two-stage style customization pipeline for SVG generation, making use of the advantages of both feed-forward T2V models and T2I image priors. In the first stage, we train a T2V diffusion model with a path-level representation to ensure the structural regularity of SVGs while preserving diverse expressive capabilities. In the second stage, we customize the T2V diffusion model to different styles by distilling customized T2I models. By integrating these techniques, our pipeline can generate high-quality and diverse SVGs in custom styles based on text prompts in an efficient feed-forward manner. The effectiveness of our method has been validated through extensive experiments. The project page is https://customsvg.github.io. | [🔗 Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10558v1) |
| [Does Feasibility Matter? Understanding the Impact of Feasibility on
  Synthetic Training Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10551v1) | Yiwen Liu, Jessica Bader, Jae Myung Kim | 2025-05-15 | Optimization, Multimodal AI, Ongoing Learning, Diffusion Models, LLM | With the development of photorealistic diffusion models, models trained in part or fully on synthetic data achieve progressively better results. However, diffusion models still routinely generate images that would not exist in reality, such as a dog floating above the ground or with unrealistic texture artifacts. We define the concept of feasibility as whether attributes in a synthetic image could realistically exist in the real-world domain; synthetic images containing attributes that violate this criterion are considered infeasible. Intuitively, infeasible images are typically considered out-of-distribution; thus, training on such images is expected to hinder a model's ability to generalize to real-world data, and they should therefore be excluded from the training set whenever possible. However, does feasibility really matter? In this paper, we investigate whether enforcing feasibility is necessary when generating synthetic training data for CLIP-based classifiers, focusing on three target attributes: background, color, and texture. We introduce VariReal, a pipeline that minimally edits a given source image to include feasible or infeasible attributes given by the textual prompt generated by a large language model. Our experiments show that feasibility minimally affects LoRA-fine-tuned CLIP performance, with mostly less than 0.3% difference in top-1 accuracy across three fine-grained datasets. Also, the attribute matters on whether the feasible/infeasible images adversarially influence the classification performance. Finally, mixing feasible and infeasible images in training datasets does not significantly impact performance compared to using purely feasible or infeasible datasets. | [🔗 Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10551v1) |
| [MASSV: Multimodal Adaptation and Self-Data Distillation for Speculative
  Decoding of Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10526v1) | Mugilan Ganesan, Shane Segal, Ankur Aggarwal, Nish Sinnadurai, Sean Lie, Vithursan Thangarasa | 2025-05-15 | Optimization, Prompt Engineering, Multimodal AI, Fine-Tuning | Speculative decoding significantly accelerates language model inference by enabling a lightweight draft model to propose multiple tokens that a larger target model verifies simultaneously. However, applying this technique to vision-language models (VLMs) presents two fundamental challenges: small language models that could serve as efficient drafters lack the architectural components to process visual inputs, and their token predictions fail to match those of VLM target models that consider visual context. We introduce Multimodal Adaptation and Self-Data Distillation for Speculative Decoding of Vision-Language Models (MASSV), which transforms existing small language models into effective multimodal drafters through a two-phase approach. MASSV first connects the target VLM's vision encoder to the draft model via a lightweight trainable projector, then applies self-distilled visual instruction tuning using responses generated by the target VLM to align token predictions. Comprehensive experiments across the Qwen2.5-VL and Gemma3 model families demonstrate that MASSV increases accepted length by up to 30% and delivers end-to-end inference speedups of up to 1.46x on visually-grounded tasks. MASSV provides a scalable, architecture-compatible method for accelerating both current and future VLMs. | [🔗 Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10526v1) |
| [Multi-Token Prediction Needs Registers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10518v1) | Anastasios Gerontopoulos, Spyros Gidaris, Nikos Komodakis | 2025-05-15 | Optimization, Fine-Tuning | Multi-token prediction has emerged as a promising objective for improving language model pretraining, but its benefits have not consistently generalized to other settings such as fine-tuning. In this paper, we propose MuToR, a simple and effective approach to multi-token prediction that interleaves learnable register tokens into the input sequence, each tasked with predicting future targets. Compared to existing methods, MuToR offers several key advantages: it introduces only a negligible number of additional parameters, requires no architectural changes--ensuring compatibility with off-the-shelf pretrained language models--and remains aligned with the next-token pretraining objective, making it especially well-suited for supervised fine-tuning. Moreover, it naturally supports scalable prediction horizons. We demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of MuToR across a range of use cases, including supervised fine-tuning, parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), and pretraining, on challenging generative tasks in both language and vision domains. Our code will be available at: https://github.com/nasosger/MuToR. | [🔗 Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10518v1) |

We introduce Neural Thermodynamic Laws (NTL) -- a new framework that offers fresh insights into LLM training dynamics. On the theoretical side, we demonstrate that key thermodynamic quantities (e.g., temperature, entropy, heat capacity, thermal conduction) and classical thermodynamic principles (e.g., the three laws of thermodynamics and the equipartition theorem) naturally emerge under river-valley loss landscape assumptions. On the practical side, this scientific perspective yields intuitive guidelines for designing learning rate schedules. | [🔗 Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10559v1) |

  Lattice Field Theory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10553v1) | Jehu Martinez, Andrea Delgado | 2025-05-15 | Training & Evaluation, Model Evaluation | Sampling from high-dimensional and structured probability distributions is a fundamental challenge in computational physics, particularly in the context of lattice field theory (LFT), where generating field configurations efficiently is critical, yet computationally intensive. In this work, we apply a previously developed hybrid quantum-classical normalizing flow model to explore quantum-enhanced sampling in such regimes. Our approach embeds parameterized quantum circuits within a classical normalizing flow architecture, leveraging amplitude encoding and quantum entanglement to enhance expressivity in the generative process. The quantum circuit serves as a trainable transformation within the flow, while classical networks provide adaptive coupling and compensate for quantum hardware imperfections. This design enables efficient density estimation and sample generation, potentially reducing the resources required compared to purely classical methods. While LFT provides a representative and physically meaningful application for benchmarking, our focus is on improving the sampling efficiency of generative models through quantum components. This work contributes toward the development of quantum-enhanced generative modeling frameworks that address the sampling bottlenecks encountered in physics and beyond. | [🔗 Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10553v1) |

This study investigates the classification of rest and task states during a realistic, interactive tennis simulation using fNIRS signals and a range of machine learning approaches. We benchmarked traditional classifiers based on engineered features, Long Short-Term Memory networks on raw time-series data, and Convolutional Neural Networks applied to Gramian Angular Field-transformed images. Ensemble models like Extra Trees and Gradient Boosting achieved accuracies above 97 percent, while the ResNet-based CNN reached 95.0 percent accuracy with a near-perfect AUC of 99.2 percent, outperforming both LSTM and EfficientNet architectures. A novel data augmentation strategy was employed to equalize trial durations while preserving physiological integrity. Feature importance analyses revealed that both oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin signals, particularly slope and RMS metrics, were key contributors to classification performance. These findings demonstrate the strong potential of fNIRS-based BCIs for deployment in dynamic, real-world environments and underscore the advantages of deep learning models in decoding complex neural signals. | [🔗 Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10536v1) |

| [Approximation-First Timeseries Monitoring Query At Scale](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10560v1) | Zeying Zhu, Jonathan Chamberlain, Kenny Wu, David Starobinski, Zaoxing Liu | 2025-05-15 | Production and Deployment, LLM Ops, Training & Evaluation | Timeseries monitoring systems such as Prometheus play a crucial role in gaining observability of the underlying system components. These systems collect timeseries metrics from various system components and perform monitoring queries over periodic window-based aggregations (i.e., rule queries). However, despite wide adoption, the operational costs and query latency of rule queries remain high. In this paper, we identify major bottlenecks associated with repeated data scans and query computations concerning window overlaps in rule queries, and present PromSketch, an approximation-first query framework as intermediate caches for monitoring systems. It enables low operational costs and query latency, by combining approximate window-based query frameworks and sketch-based precomputation. PromSketch is implemented as a standalone module that can be integrated into Prometheus and VictoriaMetrics, covering 70% of Prometheus' aggregation over time queries. Our evaluation shows that PromSketch achieves up to a two orders of magnitude reduction in query latency over Prometheus and VictoriaMetrics, while lowering operational dollar costs of query processing by two orders of magnitude compared to Prometheus and by at least 4x compared to VictoriaMetrics with at most 5% average errors across statistics.

| [Real-Time Out-of-Distribution Failure Prevention via Multi-Modal
  Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10547v1) | Milan Ganai, Rohan Sinha, Christopher Agia, Daniel Morton, Marco Pavone | 2025-05-15 | Production and Deployment, Ongoing Learning | Foundation models can provide robust high-level reasoning on appropriate safety interventions in hazardous scenarios beyond a robot's training data, i.e. out-of-distribution (OOD) failures. However, due to the high inference latency of Large Vision and Language Models, current methods rely on manually defined intervention policies to enact fallbacks, thereby lacking the ability to plan generalizable, semantically safe motions. To overcome these challenges we present FORTRESS, a framework that generates and reasons about semantically safe fallback strategies in real time to prevent OOD failures. At a low frequency in nominal operations, FORTRESS uses multi-modal reasoners to identify goals and anticipate failure modes. When a runtime monitor triggers a fallback response, FORTRESS rapidly synthesizes plans to fallback goals while inferring and avoiding semantically unsafe regions in real time. By bridging open-world, multi-modal reasoning with dynamics-aware planning, we eliminate the need for hard-coded fallbacks and human safety interventions. FORTRESS outperforms on-the-fly prompting of slow reasoning models in safety classification accuracy on synthetic benchmarks and real-world ANYmal robot data, and further improves system safety and planning success in simulation and on quadrotor hardware for urban navigation. | [🔗 Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10547v1) |
| [LibIQ: Toward Real-Time Spectrum Classification in O-RAN dApps](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10537v1) | Filippo Olimpieri, Noemi Giustini, Andrea Lacava, Salvatore D'Oro, Tommaso Melodia, Francesca Cuomo | 2025-05-15 | Production and Deployment, Security & Adversarial ML | The O-RAN architecture is transforming cellular networks by adopting RAN softwarization and disaggregation concepts to enable data-driven monitoring and control of the network. Such management is enabled by RICs, which facilitate near-real-time and non-real-time network control through xApps and rApps. However, they face limitations, including latency overhead in data exchange between the RAN and RIC, restricting real-time monitoring, and the inability to access user plain data due to privacy and security constraints, hindering use cases like beamforming and spectrum classification. In this paper, we leverage the dApps concept to enable real-time RF spectrum classification with LibIQ, a novel library for RF signals that facilitates efficient spectrum monitoring and signal classification by providing functionalities to read I/Q samples as time-series, create datasets and visualize time-series data through plots and spectrograms. Thanks to LibIQ, I/Q samples can be efficiently processed to detect external RF signals, which are subsequently classified using a CNN inside the library. To achieve accurate spectrum analysis, we created an extensive dataset of time-series-based I/Q samples, representing distinct signal types captured using a custom dApp running on a 5G deployment over the Colosseum network emulator and an OTA testbed. We evaluate our model by deploying LibIQ in heterogeneous scenarios with varying center frequencies, time windows, and external RF signals. In real-time analysis, the model classifies the processed I/Q samples, achieving an average accuracy of approximately 97.8\% in identifying signal types across all scenarios. We pledge to release both LibIQ and the dataset created as a publicly available framework upon acceptance. | [🔗 Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10537v1) |

Over the past several years, there has been an exponential increase in cyberattacks, specifically targeting vulnerable links in critical software supply chains. These attacks disrupt the day-to-day functioning and threaten the security of nearly everyone on the internet, from billion-dollar companies and government agencies to hobbyist open-source developers. The ever-evolving threat of software supply chain attacks has garnered interest from the software industry and the US government in improving software supply chain security.   On September 20, 2024, three researchers from the NSF-backed Secure Software Supply Chain Center (S3C2) conducted a Secure Software Supply Chain Summit with a diverse set of 12 practitioners from 9 companies. The goals of the Summit were to: (1) to enable sharing between individuals from different companies regarding practical experiences and challenges with software supply chain security, (2) to help form new collaborations, (3) to share our observations from our previous summits with industry, and (4) to learn about practitioners' challenges to inform our future research direction. The summit consisted of discussions of six topics relevant to the companies represented, including updating vulnerable dependencies, component and container choice, malicious commits, building infrastructure, large language models, and reducing entire classes of vulnerabilities. | [🔗 Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10538v1) |

Mann | 2025-05-15 | General AI | Studies of young planets help us understand planet evolution and investigate important evolutionary processes such as atmospheric escape. We monitored IRAS 04125+2902, a 3 Myr-old T Tauri star with a transiting planet and a transitional disk, with the SPIRou infrared spectropolarimeter on the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope. Using these data, we constrained the mass and density of the Jupiter-size companion to <0.16 M_J and <0.23 g/cm^3, respectively (90\% upper limits). These rule out a Jovian-like object and support the hypothesis that it is an ancestor to the numerous sub-Neptunes found around mature stars. We unambiguously detect magnetic fields at the stellar surface, small-scale fields reaching 1.5 kG and the large-scale field mostly consisting of a 0.80-0.95 kG dipole inclined by 5-15deg to the rotation axis. Accretion onto the star is low and/or episodic at a maximum rate of ~10^{-11} Msun/yr, indicating that IRAS 04125+2902 is most likely in a magnetic 'propeller' regime, possibly maintaining the star's slow rotation (11.3~d). We discover persistent Doppler-shifted absorption in a metastable He I line, clear evidence for a magnetized wind from a gaseous inner disk. Variability in absorption suggests structure in the disk wind that could reflect disk-planet interactions. | [🔗 Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10564v1) |

  Cs$_2$AgBiBr$_6$ investigated via x-ray diffraction and infrared phonons](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10563v1) | Collin Tower, Fereidoon S. Razavi, Jeremy Dion, Jürgen Nuss, Reinhard K. Kremer, Maureen Reedyk | 2025-05-15 | General AI | The halide double perovskite Cs$_2$AgBiBr$_6$ has been proposed as a potential replacement for organic halide perovskites for photovoltaic applications. Further investigation of its dielectric response, optical properties and structural stability is thus warranted. Cs$_2$AgBiBr$_6$ exhibits a well-documented structural phase transition at 120 K but indications for an additional lower temperature ($\sim$40 K) phase transition have also been reported. On the basis of measurements of the specific heat capacity, temperature dependent powder X-ray diffraction, low frequency capacitance, and infrared reflectivity we clarify the previously reported splitting of phonon modes in the Raman spectrum at $\sim$40 K as due to a subtle structural phase transition from the tetragonal I4/m structure to a monoclinic $P12_1$/$n1$ crystal structure. The infrared active vibrational modes are experimentally investigated in the three structural regimes. In the cubic structure at room temperature the four IR active modes are observed at 135,$\sim$95, 55, and $\sim$25 cm$^{-1}$, as the symmetry reduces to tetragonal a minute splitting of these modes is expected, however below 40 K an additional mode is observed indicating a further reduction in symmetry. | [🔗 Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10563v1) |

  response to air pollution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10556v1) | Nazanin Zounemat Kermani, Sadjad Naderi, Claire H. Dilliway, Claire E. Heaney, Shrreya Behll, Boyang Chen, Hisham Abubakar-Waziri, Alexandra E. Porter, Marc Chadeau-Hyam, Fangxin Fang, Ian M. Adcock, Kian Fan Chung, Christopher C. Pain | 2025-05-15 | General AI | Air pollution poses a significant threat to public health, causing or exacerbating many respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. In addition, climate change is bringing about more extreme weather events such as wildfires and heatwaves, which can increase levels of pollution and worsen the effects of pollution exposure. Recent advances in personal sensing have transformed the collection of behavioural and physiological data, leading to the potential for new improvements in healthcare. We wish to capitalise on this data, alongside new capabilities in AI for making time series predictions, in order to monitor and predict health outcomes for an individual. Thus, we present a novel workflow for predicting personalised health responses to pollution by integrating physiological data from wearable fitness devices with real-time environmental exposures. The data is collected from various sources in a secure and ethical manner, and is used to train an AI model to predict individual health responses to pollution exposure within a cloud-based, modular framework. We demonstrate that the AI model -- an Adversarial Autoencoder neural network in this case -- accurately reconstructs time-dependent health signals and captures nonlinear responses to pollution. Transfer learning is applied using data from a personal smartwatch, which increases the generalisation abilities of the AI model and illustrates the adaptability of the approach to real-world, user-generated data. | [🔗 Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10556v1) |
| [Spectra of contractions of the Gaussian Orthogonal Tensor Ensemble](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10555v1) | Soumendu Sundar Mukherjee, Himasish Talukdar | 2025-05-15 | General AI | In this article, we study the spectra of matrix-valued contractions of the Gaussian Orthogonal Tensor Ensemble (GOTE). Let $\mathcal{G}$ denote a random tensor of order $r$ and dimension $n$ drawn from the density \[   f(\mathcal{G}) \propto \exp\bigg(-\frac{1}{2r}\ \mathcal{G}\ ^2_{\mathrm{F}}\bigg). \] For $\mathbf{w} \in \mathbb{S}^{n - 1}$, the unit-sphere in $\mathbb{R}^n$, we consider the matrix-valued contraction $\mathcal{G} \cdot \mathbf{w}^{\otimes (r - 2)}$ when both $r$ and $n$ go to infinity such that $r / n \to c \in [0, \infty]$. We obtain semi-circle bulk-limits in all regimes, generalising the works of Goulart et al. (2022); Au and Garza-Vargas (2023); Bonnin (2024) in the fixed-$r$ setting.   We also study the edge-spectrum. We obtain a Baik-Ben Arous-P\'{e}ch\'{e} phase-transition for the largest and the smallest eigenvalues at $r = 4$, generalising a result of Mukherjee et al. (2024) in the context of adjacency matrices of random hypergraphs. We also show that the extreme eigenvectors of $\mathcal{G} \cdot \mathbf{w}^{\otimes (r - 2)}$ contain non-trivial information about the contraction direction $\mathbf{w}$.   Finally, we report some results, in the case $r = 4$, on mixed contractions $\mathcal{G} \cdot \mathbf{u} \otimes \mathbf{v}$, $\mathbf{u}, \mathbf{v} \in \mathbb{S}^{n - 1}$. While the total variation distance between the joint distribution of the entries of $\mathcal{G} \cdot \mathbf{u} \otimes \mathbf{v}$ and that of $\mathcal{G} \cdot \mathbf{u} \otimes \mathbf{u}$ goes to $0$ when $\ \mathbf{u} - \mathbf{v}\  = o(n^{-1})$, the bulk and the largest eigenvalues of these two matrices have the same limit profile as long as $\ \mathbf{u} - \mathbf{v}\  = o(1)$. Furthermore, it turns out that there are no outlier eigenvalues in the spectrum of $\mathcal{G} \cdot \mathbf{u} \otimes \mathbf{v}$ when $\langle \mathbf{u}, \mathbf{v} \rangle = o(1)$. | [🔗 Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10555v1) |

Okamura | 2025-05-15 | General AI | Grasping mechanisms must both create and subsequently hold grasps that permit safe and effective object manipulation. Existing mechanisms address the different functional requirements of grasp creation and grasp holding using a single morphology, but have yet to achieve the simultaneous strength, gentleness, and versatility needed for many applications. We present "loop closure grasping", a class of robotic grasping that addresses these different functional requirements through topological transformations between open-loop and closed-loop morphologies. We formalize these morphologies for grasping, formulate the loop closure grasping method, and present principles and a design architecture that we implement using soft growing inflated beams, winches, and clamps. The mechanisms' initial open-loop topology enables versatile grasp creation via unencumbered tip movement, and closing the loop enables strong and gentle holding with effectively infinite bending compliance. Loop closure grasping circumvents the tradeoffs of single-morphology designs, enabling grasps involving historically challenging objects, environments, and configurations. | [🔗 Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10552v1) |
| [Observing Bethe strings in an attractive Bose gas far from equilibrium](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10550v1) | Milena Horvath, Alvise Bastianello, Sudipta Dhar, Rebekka Koch, Yanliang Guo, Jean-Sébastien Caux, Manuele Landini, Hanns-Christoph Nägerl | 2025-05-15 | General AI | Bethe strings are bound states of constituent particles in a variety of interacting many-body one-dimensional (1D) integrable quantum models relevant to magnetism, nanophysics, cold atoms and beyond. As emergent fundamental excitations, they are predicted to collectively reshape observable equilibrium and dynamical properties. Small individual Bethe strings have recently been observed in quantum magnets and superconducting qubits. However, creating states featuring intermixtures of many, including large, strings remains an outstanding experimental challenge. Here, using nearly integrable ultracold Bose gases, we realize such intermixtures of Bethe strings out of equilibrium, by dynamically tuning interactions from repulsive to attractive. We measure the average binding energy of the strings, revealing the presence of bound states of more than six particles. We find further evidence for them in the momentum distribution and in Tan's contact, connected to the correlated density. Our data quantitatively agree with predictions from generalized hydrodynamics (GHD). Manipulating intermixtures of Bethe strings opens new avenues for understanding quantum coherence, nonlinear dynamics and thermalization in strongly-interacting 1D systems. | [🔗 Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10550v1) |

  2-SAT for highly regular graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10548v1) | Henrique Assumpção, Gabriel Coutinho | 2025-05-15 | General AI | We use semidefinite programming to bound the fractional cut-cover parameter of graphs in association schemes in terms of their smallest eigenvalue. We also extend the equality cases of a primal-dual inequality involving the Goemans-Williamson semidefinite program, which approximates \textsc{maxcut}, to graphs in certain coherent configurations. Moreover, we obtain spectral bounds for \textsc{max 2-sat} when the underlying graphs belong to a symmetric association scheme by means of a certain semidefinite program used to approximate quadratic programs, and we further develop this technique in order to explicitly compute the optimum value of its gauge dual in the case of distance-regular graphs. | [🔗 Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10548v1) |

This static configuration introduces significant limitations. As a result, current systems miss the opportunity to capture dynamic physiological data from diverse body regions. This research investigates the potential of developing movable sensors that adaptively reposition themselves to sample different areas of interest on the body, addressing gaps in spatial coverage. We designed, developed, and fabricated a 3 x 3 matrix platform to support moving sensors from one location to another. We validated the feasibility through simulations on a matrix of up to 9 x 9 locations with up to 16 concurrent sensors and real-world prototype characterization. | [🔗 Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10546v1) |

Weiß, Niccolò Tedeschi, Michael Matthies, Matthias Vogt, Christoph Karfusehr, Alexander Hebel, Petr Šulc, Tim Liedl, Enzo Kopperger, Friedrich C. Simmel | 2025-05-15 | General AI | Switchable elements are key components of dynamic technological and biological systems, enabling reversible transitions between well-defined states. Here, we present a DNA origami-based, mechanically bistable snap-through mechanism that can be electrically controlled. This nanoscale switch exhibits long-term stability in both states in the absence of external stimuli, while achieving millisecond-scale switching times upon application of an electric field. Individual devices sustain hundreds of thousands of switching cycles over several hours, offering a powerful platform for systematically studying the endurance and failure mechanisms of biomolecular nanoswitches. Functionalization with a gold nanorod further allows polarization-dependent optical modulation, opening avenues for applications in plasmonics. This versatile electromechanical interface has potential uses in molecular information processing, optical nanodevices, and the dynamic control of chemical reactions. | [🔗 Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10544v1) |
| [AORRTC: Almost-Surely Asymptotically Optimal Planning with RRT-Connect](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10542v1) | Tyler Wilson, Wil Thomason, Zachary Kingston, Jonathan Gammell | 2025-05-15 | General AI | Finding high-quality solutions quickly is an important objective in motion planning. This is especially true for high-degree-of-freedom robots. Satisficing planners have traditionally found feasible solutions quickly but provide no guarantees on their optimality, while almost-surely asymptotically optimal (a.s.a.o.) planners have probabilistic guarantees on their convergence towards an optimal solution but are more computationally expensive.   This paper uses the AO-x meta-algorithm to extend the satisficing RRT-Connect planner to optimal planning. The resulting Asymptotically Optimal RRT-Connect (AORRTC) finds initial solutions in similar times as RRT-Connect and uses any additional planning time to converge towards the optimal solution in an anytime manner. It is proven to be probabilistically complete and a.s.a.o.   AORRTC was tested with the Panda (7 DoF) and Fetch (8 DoF) robotic arms on the MotionBenchMaker dataset. These experiments show that AORRTC finds initial solutions as fast as RRT-Connect and faster than the tested state-of-the-art a.s.a.o. algorithms while converging to better solutions faster. AORRTC finds solutions to difficult high-DoF planning problems in milliseconds where the other a.s.a.o. planners could not consistently find solutions in seconds. This performance was demonstrated both with and without single instruction/multiple data (SIMD) acceleration. | [🔗 Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10542v1) |

Hood | 2025-05-15 | General AI | We demonstrate background-free imaging and sideband cooling of a single 133Cs atom via the narrow-line 6S1/2 to 5D5/2 electric quadrupole transition in a 1064 nm optical tweezer. The 5D5/2 state decays through the 6P3/2 state to the ground state, emitting an 852 nm wavelength photon that allows for background-free imaging. By encoding both spin and orbital angular momentum onto the 685 nm excitation light, we achieve background-free fluorescence histograms with 99.58(3)% fidelity by positioning the atom at the dark center of a vortex beam. Tuning the tweezer polarization ellipticity realizes a magic trap for the stretched F = 4, mF = 4 to F' = 6, mF' = 6 cycling transition. We cool to 5 uK in a 1.1 mK trap and outline a strategy for ground-state cooling. We compare cooling performance across different sideband regimes, while also exploring how the orbital angular momentum of structured light controls the selection rules for quadrupole transitions. These results expand the toolbox for high-fidelity quantum control and cooling in alkali-atom tweezer arrays. | [🔗 Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10540v1) |
| [A Systematic Search for Trace Molecules in Exoplanet K2-18 b](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10539v1) | Lorenzo Pica-Ciamarra, Nikku Madhusudhan, Gregory J. Cooke, Savvas Constantinou, Martin Binet | 2025-05-15 | General AI | The first transmission spectrum of the habitable-zone sub-Neptune K2-18 b with JWST has opened a new avenue for atmospheric characterisation of temperate low-mass exoplanets. The observations led to inferences of methane and carbon dioxide, as well as of dimethyl sulfide (DMS) and/or dimethyl disulfide (DMDS), both potential biosignatures. However, robust identification of DMS and/or DMDS requires further observations to increase the detection significances. More theoretical studies are also needed to identify potential false positives and possible abiotic sources for these molecules. In the present work we demonstrate the next step in this direction with a comprehensive and agnostic search for other chemical species in the atmosphere of K2-18 b. Our exploration includes 650 molecules, spanning a wide range of trace gases, including biotic, abiotic, and anthropogenic gases on Earth. We investigate possible evidence for any of these gases using three metrics: (a) evidence in the JWST mid-infrared spectrum, (b) evidence in the JWST near-infrared spectrum, and (c) plausible sources of production. We find three molecules, including DMS, which appear promising across the datasets considered. The two molecules besides DMS are diethyl sulfide and methyl acrylonitrile, which are more complex than DMS, biogenic on Earth, and have no significant sources known beyond Earth. A few other gases also provide comparable fits to a subset of the data considered but again with limited known plausible sources. Our study highlights the need for further observations to distinguish between possible trace gases in K2-18 b and theoretical work to establish their plausible sources if confirmed on this planet. | [🔗 Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10539v1) |

  and reheating on single-field slow roll models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10534v1) | Suvashis Maity | 2025-05-15 | General AI | We investigate a class of slow roll inflationary models in the light of the recent Cosmic Microwave Background constraints from Planck 2018, ACT DR6, DESI DR1, and BICEP/\textit{Keck} 2018. The combined dataset favors a higher value of the scalar spectral index $n_{_\mathrm{S}}=0.9743 \pm 0.0034$, which places increased pressure on several conventional inflationary scenarios. In this study, we analyze the observational viability of various well-motivated models, including the $\alpha$-attractor E- and T-models, chaotic inflation, hilltop inflation, and natural inflation. We incorporate the effects of a post-inflationary phase of reheating and examine how the dynamics of reheating influence the predictions in the $n_{_\mathrm{S}}-r$ plane. We also impose a lower bound on the reheating temperature based on the constraint from the effective number of relativistic species ($\Delta{N}_{\mathrm{eff}}$) arising from primordial gravitational waves. While reheating improves agreement with observations for some models, significant regions of parameter space remain disfavored. Finally, we explore the impact of a non Bunch-Davies initial state and demonstrate that it can substantially improve the fit to the $n_{_\mathrm{S}}-r$ data across a broader class of inflationary models, thereby offering a potentially viable mechanism for reconciling theory with the latest observations. | [🔗 Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10534v1) |

  six dimensions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10532v1) | David Kokoška, Marcello Ortaggio | 2025-05-15 | General AI | We study the class of six-dimensional $\Lambda$-vacuum spacetimes which admit a non-degenerate multiple Weyl aligned null direction l (thus being of Weyl type~II or more special) with a ``generic'' optical matrix. Subject to an additional assumption on the asymptotic fall-off of the Weyl tensor, we obtain the most general metric of this class, which is specified by one discrete (normalized) and three continuous parameters. All solutions turn out to be Kerr--Schild spacetimes of type~D and, in passing, we comment on their Kerr--Schild double copy. We further show that the obtained family is locally isometric to the general doubly-spinning Kerr-NUT-(A)dS metric with the NUTs parameters switched off. In particular, the Kerr-(A)dS subclass and its extensions (i.e., analytic continuation and ``infinite-rotation'' limit) are recovered when certain polynomial metric functions are assumed to be fully factorized. As a side result, a unified metric form which encompasses all three branches of the extended Kerr-(A)dS family in all even dimensions is presented in an appendix. | [🔗 Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10532v1) |

A primary parametric amplification creates a frequency-tuned nested magnon distribution in momentum space, which seeds a secondary instability marked by the emergence of enhanced antiferromagnetic correlations, mirroring Fermi surface nesting instabilities in electronic systems. In sharp contrast to the fermionic case, however, the magnon-driven instability is intrinsically non-equilibrium and fundamentally inaccessible in thermal physics. Its quantum mechanical origin sets it apart from classical instabilities such as Faraday and modulation instabilities, which underlie several instances of dynamical behavior observed in magnetic and cold-atom systems. | [🔗 Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10531v1) |

Kind, Benedikt Fauseweh | 2025-05-15 | General AI | Recent advances in analog and digital quantum-simulation platforms have enabled exploration of the spectrum of entanglement Hamiltonians via variational algorithms. In this work we analyze the convergence properties of the variationally obtained solutions and compare them to numerically exact calculations in quantum critical systems. We demonstrate that interpreting the cost functional as an integral permits the deployment of iterative quadrature schemes, thereby reducing the required number of measurements by several orders of magnitude. We further show that a modified ansatz captures deviations from the Bisognano-Wichmann form in lattice models, improves convergence, and provides a cost-function-level diagnostic for quantum phase transitions. Finally, we establish that a low cost value does not by itself guarantee convergence in trace distance. Nevertheless, it faithfully reproduces degeneracies and spectral gaps, which are essential for applications to topological phases. | [🔗 Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10530v1) |

  waves: analytical and numerical insights](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10529v1) | Hanan Hozan, Mike Baines, Alex Lukyanov | 2025-05-15 | General AI | We have shown previously that the dynamics of isolated oil slicks on the water's surface after spills is significantly influenced by surface-wave motion practically at the onset of the spreading process. In this work, we draw our attention to another practical scenario of the oil slick's behaviour in semi-confined geometries under the action of surface waves and in the presence of oil leakage source. We hypothesize that the geometric constraints should qualitatively change the oil layer response to the wave motion leading to localization of oil spill domains even at modest levels of the surface-wave perturbations. Several realistic cases were rigorously explored, with special attention paid to the interplay, the combined effect of the two factors, oil influx and wave motion. It was demonstrated quantitatively how the spreading process can be either facilitated or suppressed leading to potential confinement. | [🔗 Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10529v1) |

Christiansen, F. Loddo | 2025-05-15 | General AI | Pixel modules are currently being built for the ATLAS ITk Pixel detector upgrade. During the preproduction phase, recurring chip malfunctioning was observed during electrical testing. It was possible to bypass this issue by disabling some pixel core columns in the ITkPix readout chip. Therefore the issue is called "core column issue" which is a direct disqualifier for a pixel module. A concerning number of cases has been observed in pixel modules with ITkPix v1.1 as well as v2 chips which significantly impacts the module yield. However, the behaviour is erratic and there is not any evidence hinting at the origin of this issue. These proceedings outline the investigations of the issue, highlighting the electrical behaviour during testing, present findings from the data collected via our production database and through visual inspection, and point towards possible causes of the issue. | [🔗 Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10528v2) |
| [Sobolev and quasiconformal distortion of intermediate dimension with
  applications to conformal dimension](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10525v1) | Jonathan M. Fraser, Jeremy T. Tyson | 2025-05-15 | General AI | We study the distortion of intermediate dimension under supercritical Sobolev mappings and also under quasiconformal or quasisymmetric homeomorphisms. In particular, we extend to the setting of intermediate dimensions both the Gehring--V\"ais\"al\"a theorem on dilatation-dependent quasiconformal distortion of dimension and Kovalev's theorem on the nonexistence of metric spaces with conformal dimension strictly between zero and one. Applications include new contributions to the quasiconformal classification of Euclidean sets and a new sufficient condition for the vanishing of conformal box-counting dimension. We illustrate our conclusions with specific consequences for Bedford--McMullen carpets, samples of Mandelbrot percolation, and product sets containing a polynomially convergent sequence factor. | [🔗 Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10525v1) |
| [AGN star dynamics under the Influence of Outflow-Ambient Interactions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10524v1) | Muxin Liu, Lile Wang, Peng Peng | 2025-05-15 | General AI | Stars with outflows interacting with ambient gas experience accelerations arising from the gravitational feedback induced by the interaction structure. In this work, three-dimensional (3D) local shearing box simulations are performed to investigate the dynamical evolution of a star with outflows embedded in the outer regions of an active galactic nucleus (AGN) disk. Two types of stellar wind are considered: isotropic winds and axisymmetric jets, along with variations in the radial pressure gradient profile. The results show that anti-friction enables AGN stars to acquire angular momentum from the ambient gas, resulting in outward migration away from the disk center. The formation and stability of the head-wind structure, which is crucial for maintaining anti-friction, are sensitive to both the strength of the stellar outflow and the radial pressure gradient of the disk gas. Once the head-wind structure is disrupted, the anti-friction effect ceases to operate effectively. A case study is also presented, focusing on a stellar-mass black hole (sBH) in an AGN disk. It is shown that jet material launched along the z-axis is confined to the trailing side of the object's motion by high gas inflow velocities, thereby activating anti-friction and inducing outward migration. If such an sBH migrates inward initially, the interplay between inward and outward migration may trap it at an equilibrium radius, potentially facilitating the formation and merger of black hole binaries. | [🔗 Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10524v1) |
| [Magnetic deflection of high-spin sodium dimers formed on helium
  nanodroplets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10523v1) | Thomas H. Villers, Benjamin S. Kamerin, Vitaly V. Kresin | 2025-05-15 | General AI | Spectroscopic data on alkali-atom dimers residing on the surface of liquid helium nanodroplets have revealed that they are detected primarily in the weakly bound, metastable, spin-triplet state. Here, by measuring the magnetic Stern-Gerlach deflection of a sodium-doped nanodroplet beam, we transparently demonstrate the abundance of high-magnetic-moment dimers. Their electron spins thermalize with the cryogenic superfluid droplets and become fully oriented by the external magnetic field. | [🔗 Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10523v1) |
| [Commuting probability for conjugate subgroups of a finite group](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10521v1) | Eloisa Detomi, Robert M. Guralnick, Marta Morigi, Pavel Shumyatsky | 2025-05-15 | General AI | Given two subgroups H,K of a finite group G, the probability that a pair of random elements from H and K commutes is denoted by \pr(H,K). We address the following question.   Let P be a p-subgroup of a finite group G and assume that \pr(P,P^x)\geq\e>0 for every x\in G. Is the order of P modulo O_p(G) bounded in terms of e only?   With respect to this question, we establish several positive results but show that in general the answer is negative. In particular, we prove that if the composition factors of G which are isomorphic to simple groups of Lie type in characteristic p, have Lie rank at most n, then the order of P modulo O_p(G) is bounded in terms of n and e only. If P is a Sylow p-subgroup of G, then the order of P modulo O_p(G) is bounded in terms e only. Some other results of similar flavour are established.   We also show that if \pr(P_1,P_2)>0 for every two Sylow p-subgroups P_1,P_2 of a profinite group G, then O_{p,p'}(G) is open in G. | [🔗 Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10521v1) |

| [On the Foundations of the Design-Based Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10519v1) | P. M. Aronow, Austin Jang, Molly Offer-Westort | 2025-05-15 | General AI | The design-based paradigm may be adopted in causal queries and survey sampling when we assume Rubin's stable unit treatment value assumption (SUTVA) or impose similar frameworks. While often taken for granted, such assumptions entail strong claims about the data generating process. We develop an alternative design-based approach: we first invoke a generalized, non-parametric model that allows for unrestricted forms of interference, such as spillover. We define a new set of inferential targets and discuss their interpretation under SUTVA and a weaker assumption that we call the No Unmodeled Revealable Variation Assumption (NURVA). We then reconstruct the standard paradigm, reconsidering SUTVA at the end rather than assuming it at the beginning. Despite its similarity to SUTVA, we demonstrate the practical insufficiency of NURVA in identifying substantively interesting quantities. In so doing, we provide clarity on the nature and importance of SUTVA for applied research. | [🔗 Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10519v1) |
| [A Tutorial on Structural Identifiability of Epidemic Models Using
  StructuralIdentifiability.jl](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10517v1) | Yuganthi R. Liyanage, Omar Saucedo, Necibe Tuncer, Gerardo Chowell | 2025-05-15 | General AI | Structural identifiability -- the theoretical ability to uniquely recover model parameters from ideal, noise-free data -- is a prerequisite for reliable parameter estimation in epidemic modeling. Despite its importance, structural identifiability analysis remains underutilized in the infectious disease modeling literature. In this tutorial, we present a practical and reproducible workflow for conducting structural identifiability analysis of ordinary differential equation models using the Julia package \texttt{StructuralIdentifiability.jl}. We apply the tool to a range of epidemic models, including SEIR variants with asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic transmission, vector-borne systems, and models incorporating hospitalization and disease-induced mortality. We compare results from StructuralIdentifiability.jl with those obtained using DAISY, a widely used differential algebra tool, and highlight cases where the Julia package succeeds in analyzing models that DAISY cannot handle. Our findings underscore how identifiability depends on model structure, the availability of initial conditions, and the choice of observed states. All code and diagrams are publicly available, making this tutorial a valuable reference for researchers and educators working with dynamic disease models. | [🔗 Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10517v1) |
