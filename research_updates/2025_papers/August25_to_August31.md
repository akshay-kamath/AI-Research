| [Reusing Computation in Text-to-Image Diffusion for Efficient Generation
  of Image Sets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21032v1) | Dale Decatur, Thibault Groueix, Wang Yifan, Rana Hanocka, Vladimir Kim, Matheus Gadelha | 2025-08-28 | Diffusion Models | Text-to-image diffusion models enable high-quality image generation but are computationally expensive. While prior work optimizes per-inference efficiency, we explore an orthogonal approach: reducing redundancy across correlated prompts. Our method leverages the coarse-to-fine nature of diffusion models, where early denoising steps capture shared structures among similar prompts. We propose a training-free approach that clusters prompts based on semantic similarity and shares computation in early diffusion steps. Experiments show that for models trained conditioned on image embeddings, our approach significantly reduces compute cost while improving image quality. By leveraging UnClip's text-to-image prior, we enhance diffusion step allocation for greater efficiency. Our method seamlessly integrates with existing pipelines, scales with prompt sets, and reduces the environmental and financial burden of large-scale text-to-image generation.

| [System size and event shape dependence of particle-identified balance
  functions in proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21030v1) | Subash Chandra Behera, Arvind Khuntia | 2025-08-28 | Diffusion Models | We investigate charge balance functions for identified hadron pairs (pions, kaons, and protons) in proton-proton (pp) collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13$~TeV, using transverse spherocity to classify event topology and charged particle multiplicity to select system size. Simulations with PYTHIA8 and EPOS-LHC reveal that balance function widths in rapidity and azimuthal angle depend on multiplicity and event shape. In PYTHIA8, widths decrease monotonically with multiplicity, consistent with local charge conservation in a fragmentation-dominated scenario. In contrast, the EPOS-LHC model, especially when using the core corona implementation, exhibits a more intricate response, where the combined effects of hydrodynamic radial flow and longitudinal diffusion result in narrower azimuthal correlations and broader rapidity correlations. These features are characteristic signatures of collective dynamics, similar to those observed in heavy-ion collisions. Events with low spherocity, which are jet-like in nature, exhibit significantly narrower balance function widths compared to isotropic events with high spherocity, illustrating that event shape selection provides clear sensitivity to the underlying dynamics of particle production in pp collisions. The species dependence and event-shape sensitivity of the widths provide differential probes of hadronization dynamics and collectivity in small systems. These results demonstrate that multidimensional, particle-identified balance function measurements can disentangle the underlying mechanisms of charge correlations and medium-like behavior in high-multiplicity pp collisions. | [🔗 Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21030v1) |

| [OneReward: Unified Mask-Guided Image Generation via Multi-Task Human
  Preference Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21066v1) | Yuan Gong, Xionghui Wang, Jie Wu, Shiyin Wang, Yitong Wang, Xinglong Wu | 2025-08-28 | RLHF, Fine-Tuning, Multimodal AI, LLM, Optimization, Diffusion Models, Training & Evaluation | In this paper, we introduce OneReward, a unified reinforcement learning framework that enhances the model's generative capabilities across multiple tasks under different evaluation criteria using only \textit{One Reward} model. By employing a single vision-language model (VLM) as the generative reward model, which can distinguish the winner and loser for a given task and a given evaluation criterion, it can be effectively applied to multi-task generation models, particularly in contexts with varied data and diverse task objectives. We utilize OneReward for mask-guided image generation, which can be further divided into several sub-tasks such as image fill, image extend, object removal, and text rendering, involving a binary mask as the edit area. Although these domain-specific tasks share same conditioning paradigm, they differ significantly in underlying data distributions and evaluation metrics. Existing methods often rely on task-specific supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which limits generalization and training efficiency. Building on OneReward, we develop Seedream 3.0 Fill, a mask-guided generation model trained via multi-task reinforcement learning directly on a pre-trained base model, eliminating the need for task-specific SFT. Experimental results demonstrate that our unified edit model consistently outperforms both commercial and open-source competitors, such as Ideogram, Adobe Photoshop, and FLUX Fill [Pro], across multiple evaluation dimensions.

| [OnGoal: Tracking and Visualizing Conversational Goals in Multi-Turn
  Dialogue with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21061v1) | Adam Coscia, Shunan Guo, Eunyee Koh, Alex Endert | 2025-08-28 | RLHF, Training & Evaluation | As multi-turn dialogues with large language models (LLMs) grow longer and more complex, how can users better evaluate and review progress on their conversational goals? We present OnGoal, an LLM chat interface that helps users better manage goal progress. OnGoal provides real-time feedback on goal alignment through LLM-assisted evaluation, explanations for evaluation results with examples, and overviews of goal progression over time, enabling users to navigate complex dialogues more effectively. Through a study with 20 participants on a writing task, we evaluate OnGoal against a baseline chat interface without goal tracking. Using OnGoal, participants spent less time and effort to achieve their goals while exploring new prompting strategies to overcome miscommunication, suggesting tracking and visualizing goals can enhance engagement and resilience in LLM dialogues. Our findings inspired design implications for future LLM chat interfaces that improve goal communication, reduce cognitive load, enhance interactivity, and enable feedback to improve LLM performance. | [🔗 Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21061v1) |
| [HITTER: A HumanoId Table TEnnis Robot via Hierarchical Planning and
  Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21043v1) | Zhi Su, Bike Zhang, Nima Rahmanian, Yuman Gao, Qiayuan Liao, Caitlin Regan, Koushil Sreenath, S. Shankar Sastry | 2025-08-28 | RLHF | Humanoid robots have recently achieved impressive progress in locomotion and whole-body control, yet they remain constrained in tasks that demand rapid interaction with dynamic environments through manipulation. Table tennis exemplifies such a challenge: with ball speeds exceeding 5 m/s, players must perceive, predict, and act within sub-second reaction times, requiring both agility and precision. To address this, we present a hierarchical framework for humanoid table tennis that integrates a model-based planner for ball trajectory prediction and racket target planning with a reinforcement learning-based whole-body controller. The planner determines striking position, velocity and timing, while the controller generates coordinated arm and leg motions that mimic human strikes and maintain stability and agility across consecutive rallies. Moreover, to encourage natural movements, human motion references are incorporated during training. We validate our system on a general-purpose humanoid robot, achieving up to 106 consecutive shots with a human opponent and sustained exchanges against another humanoid. These results demonstrate real-world humanoid table tennis with sub-second reactive control, marking a step toward agile and interactive humanoid behaviors. | [🔗 Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21043v1) |

| [Dress&Dance: Dress up and Dance as You Like It - Technical Preview](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21070v1) | Jun-Kun Chen, Aayush Bansal, Minh Phuoc Vo, Yu-Xiong Wang | 2025-08-28 | Multimodal AI, Diffusion Models | We present Dress&Dance, a video diffusion framework that generates high quality 5-second-long 24 FPS virtual try-on videos at 1152x720 resolution of a user wearing desired garments while moving in accordance with a given reference video. Our approach requires a single user image and supports a range of tops, bottoms, and one-piece garments, as well as simultaneous tops and bottoms try-on in a single pass. Key to our framework is CondNet, a novel conditioning network that leverages attention to unify multi-modal inputs (text, images, and videos), thereby enhancing garment registration and motion fidelity. CondNet is trained on heterogeneous training data, combining limited video data and a larger, more readily available image dataset, in a multistage progressive manner. Dress&Dance outperforms existing open source and commercial solutions and enables a high quality and flexible try-on experience. | [🔗 Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21070v1) |
| [MMG-Vid: Maximizing Marginal Gains at Segment-level and Token-level for
  Efficient Video LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21044v1) | Junpeng Ma, Qizhe Zhang, Ming Lu, Zhibin Wang, Qiang Zhou, Jun Song, Shanghang Zhang | 2025-08-28 | Multimodal AI, Optimization | Video Large Language Models (VLLMs) excel in video understanding, but their excessive visual tokens pose a significant computational challenge for real-world applications. Current methods aim to enhance inference efficiency by visual token pruning. However, they do not consider the dynamic characteristics and temporal dependencies of video frames, as they perceive video understanding as a multi-frame task. To address these challenges, we propose MMG-Vid, a novel training-free visual token pruning framework that removes redundancy by Maximizing Marginal Gains at both segment-level and token-level. Specifically, we first divide the video into segments based on frame similarity, and then dynamically allocate the token budget for each segment to maximize the marginal gain of each segment. Subsequently, we propose a temporal-guided DPC algorithm that jointly models inter-frame uniqueness and intra-frame diversity, thereby maximizing the marginal gain of each token. By combining both stages, MMG-Vid can maximize the utilization of the limited token budget, significantly improving efficiency while maintaining strong performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MMG-Vid can maintain over 99.5% of the original performance, while effectively reducing 75% visual tokens and accelerating the prefilling stage by 3.9x on LLaVA-OneVision-7B. Code will be released soon. | [🔗 Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21044v1) |
| [Predicting Trends in $V_{OC}$ Through Rapid, Multimodal Characterization
  of State-of-the-Art p-i-n Perovskite Devices](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21037v1) | Amy E. Louks, Brandon T. Motes, Anthony T. Troupe, Axel F. Palmstrom, Joseph J. Berry, Dane W. deQuilettes | 2025-08-28 | Multimodal AI, Optimization | Perovskite photovoltaic technologies are approaching commercial deployment, yet single junction and tandem architectures both still have significant room to improve power conversion efficiency and stability. The ability to perform rapid screening of material quality after altering processing conditions is critical to accelerating the optimization and commercialization of perovskite-based technologies. Currently, researchers utilize a wide range of stand-alone metrology tools to isolate sources of power loss throughout a device stack, which can be slow and labor intensive. Here, we demonstrate the use of a multimodal metrology approach to rapidly determine the maximum achievable and predicted open circuit voltages of > 100 perovskite devices during fabrication. Acquisition of these different data are facilitated by combining them into a single integrated measurement platform. We show that these data and automated analysis can be used to rapidly understand and ultimately predict quantitative trends in open circuit voltages of state-of-the-art devices architectures. The data and automated analysis workflow presented provides a reliable approach to quickly identify absorber and charge transport layer combinations that can lead to improved open circuit voltages. | [🔗 Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21037v1) |

| [Mixture of Contexts for Long Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21058v1) | Shengqu Cai, Ceyuan Yang, Lvmin Zhang, Yuwei Guo, Junfei Xiao, Ziyan Yang, Yinghao Xu, Zhenheng Yang, Alan Yuille, Leonidas Guibas, Maneesh Agrawala, Lu Jiang, Gordon Wetzstein | 2025-08-28 | Scaling Laws, Memory & Context Length, Multimodal AI, Diffusion Models | Long video generation is fundamentally a long context memory problem: models must retain and retrieve salient events across a long range without collapsing or drifting. However, scaling diffusion transformers to generate long-context videos is fundamentally limited by the quadratic cost of self-attention, which makes memory and computation intractable and difficult to optimize for long sequences. We recast long-context video generation as an internal information retrieval task and propose a simple, learnable sparse attention routing module, Mixture of Contexts (MoC), as an effective long-term memory retrieval engine. In MoC, each query dynamically selects a few informative chunks plus mandatory anchors (caption, local windows) to attend to, with causal routing that prevents loop closures. As we scale the data and gradually sparsify the routing, the model allocates compute to salient history, preserving identities, actions, and scenes over minutes of content. Efficiency follows as a byproduct of retrieval (near-linear scaling), which enables practical training and synthesis, and the emergence of memory and consistency at the scale of minutes. | [🔗 Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21058v1) |
| [Activity propagation with Hebbian learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21053v1) | Will T. Engedal, Róbert Juhász, István A. Kovács | 2025-08-28 | Scaling Laws | We investigate the impact of Hebbian learning on the contact process, a paradigmatic model for infection spreading, which has been also proposed as a simple model to capture the dynamics of inter-regional brain activity propagation as well as population spreading. Each of these contexts calls for an extension of the contact process with local learning. We introduce Hebbian learning as a positive or negative reinforcement of the activation rate between a pair of sites after each successful activation event. Learning can happen either in both directions motivated by social distancing (mutual learning model), or in only one of the directions motivated by brain and population dynamics (source or target learning models). Hebbian learning leads to a rich class of emergent behavior, where local incentives can lead to the opposite global effects. In general, positive reinforcement (increasing activation rates) leads to a loss of the active phase, while negative reinforcement (reducing activation rates) can turn the inactive phase into a globally active phase. In two dimensions and above, the effect of negative reinforcement is twofold: it promotes the spreading of activity, but at the same time gives rise to the appearance of effectively immune regions, entailing the emergence of two distinct critical points. Positive reinforcement can lead to Griffiths effects with non-universal power-law scaling, through the formation of random loops of activity, a manifestation of the ``ant mill" phenomenon. | [🔗 Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21053v1) |

| [Multi-View 3D Point Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21060v1) | Frano Rajič, Haofei Xu, Marko Mihajlovic, Siyuan Li, Irem Demir, Emircan Gündoğdu, Lei Ke, Sergey Prokudin, Marc Pollefeys, Siyu Tang | 2025-08-28 | Training & Evaluation, LLM, Multimodal AI, Optimization | We introduce the first data-driven multi-view 3D point tracker, designed to track arbitrary points in dynamic scenes using multiple camera views. Unlike existing monocular trackers, which struggle with depth ambiguities and occlusion, or prior multi-camera methods that require over 20 cameras and tedious per-sequence optimization, our feed-forward model directly predicts 3D correspondences using a practical number of cameras (e.g., four), enabling robust and accurate online tracking. Given known camera poses and either sensor-based or estimated multi-view depth, our tracker fuses multi-view features into a unified point cloud and applies k-nearest-neighbors correlation alongside a transformer-based update to reliably estimate long-range 3D correspondences, even under occlusion. We train on 5K synthetic multi-view Kubric sequences and evaluate on two real-world benchmarks: Panoptic Studio and DexYCB, achieving median trajectory errors of 3.1 cm and 2.0 cm, respectively. Our method generalizes well to diverse camera setups of 1-8 views with varying vantage points and video lengths of 24-150 frames. By releasing our tracker alongside training and evaluation datasets, we aim to set a new standard for multi-view 3D tracking research and provide a practical tool for real-world applications.

| [FakeParts: a New Family of AI-Generated DeepFakes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21052v1) | Gaetan Brison, Soobash Daiboo, Samy Aimeur, Awais Hussain Sani, Xi Wang, Gianni Franchi, Vicky Kalogeiton | 2025-08-28 | Training & Evaluation, Multimodal AI | We introduce FakeParts, a new class of deepfakes characterized by subtle, localized manipulations to specific spatial regions or temporal segments of otherwise authentic videos. Unlike fully synthetic content, these partial manipulations, ranging from altered facial expressions to object substitutions and background modifications, blend seamlessly with real elements, making them particularly deceptive and difficult to detect. To address the critical gap in detection capabilities, we present FakePartsBench, the first large-scale benchmark dataset specifically designed to capture the full spectrum of partial deepfakes. Comprising over 25K videos with pixel-level and frame-level manipulation annotations, our dataset enables comprehensive evaluation of detection methods. Our user studies demonstrate that FakeParts reduces human detection accuracy by over 30% compared to traditional deepfakes, with similar performance degradation observed in state-of-the-art detection models. This work identifies an urgent vulnerability in current deepfake detection approaches and provides the necessary resources to develop more robust methods for partial video manipulations. | [🔗 Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21052v1) |
| [Veritas: Generalizable Deepfake Detection via Pattern-Aware Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21048v1) | Hao Tan, Jun Lan, Zichang Tan, Ajian Liu, Chuanbiao Song, Senyuan Shi, Huijia Zhu, Weiqiang Wang, Jun Wan, Zhen Lei | 2025-08-28 | Training & Evaluation, LLM, Prompt Engineering | Deepfake detection remains a formidable challenge due to the complex and evolving nature of fake content in real-world scenarios. However, existing academic benchmarks suffer from severe discrepancies from industrial practice, typically featuring homogeneous training sources and low-quality testing images, which hinder the practical deployments of current detectors. To mitigate this gap, we introduce HydraFake, a dataset that simulates real-world challenges with hierarchical generalization testing. Specifically, HydraFake involves diversified deepfake techniques and in-the-wild forgeries, along with rigorous training and evaluation protocol, covering unseen model architectures, emerging forgery techniques and novel data domains. Building on this resource, we propose Veritas, a multi-modal large language model (MLLM) based deepfake detector. Different from vanilla chain-of-thought (CoT), we introduce pattern-aware reasoning that involves critical reasoning patterns such as "planning" and "self-reflection" to emulate human forensic process. We further propose a two-stage training pipeline to seamlessly internalize such deepfake reasoning capacities into current MLLMs. Experiments on HydraFake dataset reveal that although previous detectors show great generalization on cross-model scenarios, they fall short on unseen forgeries and data domains. Our Veritas achieves significant gains across different OOD scenarios, and is capable of delivering transparent and faithful detection outputs. | [🔗 Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21048v1) |
| [DSROQ: Dynamic Scheduling and Routing for QoE Management in LEO
  Satellite Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21047v1) | Dhiraj Bhattacharjee, Pablo G. Madoery, Abhishek Naik, Halim Yanikomeroglu, Gunes Karabulut Kurt, Stephane Martel, Khaled Ahmed | 2025-08-28 | Training & Evaluation, Responsible AI, Production and Deployment, Optimization | The modern Internet supports diverse applications with heterogeneous quality of service (QoS) requirements. Low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite constellations offer a promising solution to meet these needs, enhancing coverage in rural areas and complementing terrestrial networks in urban regions. Ensuring QoS in such networks requires joint optimization of routing, bandwidth allocation, and dynamic queue scheduling, as traffic handling is critical for maintaining service performance. This paper formulates a joint routing and bandwidth allocation problem where QoS requirements are treated as soft constraints, aiming to maximize user experience. An adaptive scheduling approach is introduced to prioritize flow-specific QoS needs. We propose a Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS)-inspired method to solve the NP-hard route and bandwidth allocation problem, with Lyapunov optimization-based scheduling applied during reward evaluation. Using the Starlink Phase 1 Version 2 constellation, we compare end-user experience and fairness between our proposed DSROQ algorithm and a benchmark scheme. Results show that DSROQ improves both performance metrics and demonstrates the advantage of joint routing and bandwidth decisions. Furthermore, we observe that the dominant performance factor shifts from scheduling to routing and bandwidth allocation as traffic sensitivity changes from latency-driven to bandwidth-driven. | [🔗 Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21047v1) |

  domain shift](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21035v1) | Gennaro Percannella, Mattia Sarno, Francesco Tortorella, Mario Vento | 2025-08-28 | Training & Evaluation | Recognizing atypical mitotic figures in histopathology images allows physicians to correctly assess tumor aggressiveness. Although machine learning models could be exploited for automatically performing such a task, under domain shift these models suffer from significative performance drops. In this work, an approach based on multi-task learning is proposed for addressing this problem. By exploiting auxiliary tasks, correlated to the main classification task, the proposed approach, submitted to the track 2 of the MItosis DOmain Generalization (MIDOG) challenge, aims to aid the model to focus only on the object to classify, ignoring the domain varying background of the image. The proposed approach shows promising performance in a preliminary evaluation conducted on three distinct datasets, i.e., the MIDOG 2025 Atypical Training Set, the Ami-Br dataset, as well as the preliminary test set of the MIDOG25 challenge. | [🔗 Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21035v1) |

| [First-Place Solution to NeurIPS 2024 Invisible Watermark Removal
  Challenge](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21072v1) | Fahad Shamshad, Tameem Bakr, Yahia Shaaban, Noor Hussein, Karthik Nandakumar, Nils Lukas | 2025-08-28 | Model Evaluation, AI Safety, Optimization, Diffusion Models, Responsible AI, Security & Adversarial ML | Content watermarking is an important tool for the authentication and copyright protection of digital media. However, it is unclear whether existing watermarks are robust against adversarial attacks. We present the winning solution to the NeurIPS 2024 Erasing the Invisible challenge, which stress-tests watermark robustness under varying degrees of adversary knowledge. The challenge consisted of two tracks: a black-box and beige-box track, depending on whether the adversary knows which watermarking method was used by the provider. For the beige-box track, we leverage an adaptive VAE-based evasion attack, with a test-time optimization and color-contrast restoration in CIELAB space to preserve the image's quality. For the black-box track, we first cluster images based on their artifacts in the spatial or frequency-domain. Then, we apply image-to-image diffusion models with controlled noise injection and semantic priors from ChatGPT-generated captions to each cluster with optimized parameter settings. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our method successfully achieves near-perfect watermark removal (95.7%) with negligible impact on the residual image's quality. We hope that our attacks inspire the development of more robust image watermarking methods. | [🔗 Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21072v1) |
| [Learning on the Fly: Rapid Policy Adaptation via Differentiable
  Simulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21065v1) | Jiahe Pan, Jiaxu Xing, Rudolf Reiter, Yifan Zhai, Elie Aljalbout, Davide Scaramuzza | 2025-08-28 | Model Evaluation, Ongoing Learning, Responsible AI | Learning control policies in simulation enables rapid, safe, and cost-effective development of advanced robotic capabilities. However, transferring these policies to the real world remains difficult due to the sim-to-real gap, where unmodeled dynamics and environmental disturbances can degrade policy performance. Existing approaches, such as domain randomization and Real2Sim2Real pipelines, can improve policy robustness, but either struggle under out-of-distribution conditions or require costly offline retraining. In this work, we approach these problems from a different perspective. Instead of relying on diverse training conditions before deployment, we focus on rapidly adapting the learned policy in the real world in an online fashion. To achieve this, we propose a novel online adaptive learning framework that unifies residual dynamics learning with real-time policy adaptation inside a differentiable simulation. Starting from a simple dynamics model, our framework refines the model continuously with real-world data to capture unmodeled effects and disturbances such as payload changes and wind. The refined dynamics model is embedded in a differentiable simulation framework, enabling gradient backpropagation through the dynamics and thus rapid, sample-efficient policy updates beyond the reach of classical RL methods like PPO. All components of our system are designed for rapid adaptation, enabling the policy to adjust to unseen disturbances within 5 seconds of training. We validate the approach on agile quadrotor control under various disturbances in both simulation and the real world. Our framework reduces hovering error by up to 81% compared to L1-MPC and 55% compared to DATT, while also demonstrating robustness in vision-based control without explicit state estimation. | [🔗 Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21065v1) |

  Atypical Mitotic Figure Classification in MIDOG 2025](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21041v1) | Guillaume Balezo, Raphaël Bourgade, Thomas Walter | 2025-08-28 | Model Evaluation, LLM, Optimization, Responsible AI | Atypical mitotic figures (AMFs) are markers of abnormal cell division associated with poor prognosis, yet their detection remains difficult due to low prevalence, subtle morphology, and inter-observer variability. The MIDOG 2025 challenge introduces a benchmark for AMF classification across multiple domains. In this work, we evaluate the recently published DINOv3-H+ vision transformer, pretrained on natural images, which we fine-tuned using low-rank adaptation (LoRA, 650k trainable parameters) and extensive augmentation. Despite the domain gap, DINOv3 transfers effectively to histopathology, achieving a balanced accuracy of 0.8871 on the preliminary test set. These results highlight the robustness of DINOv3 pretraining and show that, when combined with parameter-efficient fine-tuning, it provides a strong baseline for atypical mitosis classification in MIDOG 2025. | [🔗 Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21041v1) |

Although machine learning algorithms could be exploited for aiding physicians in accurately performing such a task, these algorithms suffer from significative performance drop when evaluated on images coming from domains that are different from the training ones. In this work, we propose a Mamba-based approach for mitosis detection under domain shift, inspired by the promising performance demonstrated by Mamba in medical imaging segmentation tasks. Specifically, our approach exploits a VM-UNet architecture for carrying out the addressed task, as well as stain augmentation operations for further improving model robustness against domain shift. Our approach has been submitted to the track 1 of the MItosis DOmain Generalization (MIDOG) challenge. Preliminary experiments, conducted on the MIDOG++ dataset, show large room for improvement for the proposed method. | [🔗 Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21033v1) |

  Instruction-Driven Routing & Sparsification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21046v1) | Wei Li, Renshan Zhang, Rui Shao, Jie He, Liqiang Nie | 2025-08-28 | Production and Deployment, Multimodal AI, Optimization | Recent Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models built on pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) require extensive post-training, resulting in high computational overhead that limits scalability and deployment.We propose CogVLA, a Cognition-Aligned Vision-Language-Action framework that leverages instruction-driven routing and sparsification to improve both efficiency and performance. CogVLA draws inspiration from human multimodal coordination and introduces a 3-stage progressive architecture. 1) Encoder-FiLM based Aggregation Routing (EFA-Routing) injects instruction information into the vision encoder to selectively aggregate and compress dual-stream visual tokens, forming a instruction-aware latent representation. 2) Building upon this compact visual encoding, LLM-FiLM based Pruning Routing (LFP-Routing) introduces action intent into the language model by pruning instruction-irrelevant visually grounded tokens, thereby achieving token-level sparsity. 3) To ensure that compressed perception inputs can still support accurate and coherent action generation, we introduce V-L-A Coupled Attention (CAtten), which combines causal vision-language attention with bidirectional action parallel decoding. Extensive experiments on the LIBERO benchmark and real-world robotic tasks demonstrate that CogVLA achieves state-of-the-art performance with success rates of 97.4% and 70.0%, respectively, while reducing training costs by 2.5-fold and decreasing inference latency by 2.8-fold compared to OpenVLA. CogVLA is open-sourced and publicly available at https://github.com/JiuTian-VL/CogVLA. | [🔗 Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21046v1) |

  Industrial SMEs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21024v1) | Mathieu Bourdin, Anas Neumann, Thomas Paviot, Robert Pellerin, Samir Lamouri | 2025-08-28 | Responsible AI, RAG | Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful solution to mitigate the limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs), such as hallucinations and outdated knowledge. However, deploying RAG-based tools in Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) remains a challenge due to their limited resources and lack of expertise in natural language processing (NLP). This paper introduces EASI-RAG, Enterprise Application Support for Industrial RAG, a structured, agile method designed to facilitate the deployment of RAG systems in industrial SME contexts. EASI-RAG is based on method engineering principles and comprises well-defined roles, activities, and techniques. The method was validated through a real-world case study in an environmental testing laboratory, where a RAG tool was implemented to answer operators queries using data extracted from operational procedures. The system was deployed in under a month by a team with no prior RAG experience and was later iteratively improved based on user feedback. Results demonstrate that EASI-RAG supports fast implementation, high user adoption, delivers accurate answers, and enhances the reliability of underlying data. This work highlights the potential of RAG deployment in industrial SMEs. Future works include the need for generalization across diverse use cases and further integration with fine-tuned models. | [🔗 Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21024v1) |

| [Breaking bad theories of class $\mathcal S$](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21071v1) | Riccardo Comi, Sebastiano Garavaglia, Simone Giacomelli, Sara Pasquetti, Palash Singh | 2025-08-28 | General AI | We study weakly-coupled descriptions/channel decompositions of the 4d $\mathcal{N}=2$ theories of class $\mathcal{S}$ of type $\mathfrak{su}(N)$, from the perspective of the 3d $\mathcal{N}=4$ mirror duals of their circle compactifications. This is a delicate problem when the channel decomposition produces pathological, or bad, 4d configurations that correspond to spheres with non-maximal punctures. The star-shaped quivers, describing the 3d mirrors associated with such bad 4d configurations, are bad 3d $\mathcal{N}=4$ theories. Leveraging recent results regarding 3d bad theories, we identify a new and interesting family of bad theories, which we coin \textit{broken} theories, that naturally arise in this context. Using these broken theories, we develop a systematic and analytic method that determines the generically non-Lagrangian matter sectors and the weakly-coupled gauge groups in such channel decompositions. We understand these weakly-coupled descriptions as emerging dynamically via Higgs mechanisms triggered by operators acquiring vacuum expectation values. | [🔗 Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21071v1) |

Bianchi, Luigi Castiglioni, Silvia Penati, Marcia Tenser, Diego Trancanelli | 2025-08-28 | General AI | We investigate the role of framing in a family of 1/24 BPS Wilson loops in ABJ(M) theory, which define flows of supersymmetric defect field theories, interpolating between the 1/6 BPS and the 1/2 BPS superconformal fixed points. We analyze in perturbation theory how framing affects both the expectation values of these operators and the correlation functions of local insertions on the defect, as well as its interplay with RG flow and the g-theorem. We obtain a non-trivial identity between the one-point function of the defect stress tensor and a Q-exact correlator, which establishes a direct link between scale invariance, superconformal invariance and framing, and clarifies the deep connection between scale and cohomological anomalies. Finally, we propose a holographic interpretation of framing at strong coupling, identifying it with a coupling to the background B-field in the dual string theory. | [🔗 Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21068v1) |
| [Rapid late-time reionization: constraints and cosmological implications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21069v1) | Willem Elbers | 2025-08-28 | General AI | We present constraints on the reionization optical depth, $\tau$, obtained using several independent methods. First, we perform a non-parametric reconstruction of the reionization history, using Lyman-$\alpha$ constraints on the evolution of the volume-averaged neutral hydrogen fraction, $x_\mathrm{HI}(z)$, including recent results from the James Webb Space Telescope. When combined with baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements from DESI and Big Bang nucleosynthesis constraints, these data imply a rapid reionization history ($z_\mathrm{mid}=7.00^{+0.12}_{-0.18}$ and $\Delta z_{50}=1.12^{+0.12}_{-0.29}$) and a value of $\tau=0.0492^{+0.0014}_{-0.0030}$, which is largely insensitive to the assumed cosmological model and independent of cosmic microwave background (CMB) data. The optical depth can also be measured from large-scale $(\ell<30)$ CMB polarization data, yielding constraints that are similarly model-insensitive and consistent with the Ly$\alpha$ bound. Third, $\tau$ may be constrained from the attenuation of small-scale $(\ell>30)$ CMB anisotropies, but the results are sensitive to the choice of cosmological model. Assuming $\Lambda$CDM and combining small-scale CMB data with CMB lensing and type 1a supernovae (SNe) yields tight constraints that are compatible with the Ly$\alpha$ bound. Adding galaxy clustering and lensing measurements brings the constraints further into agreement with the Ly$\alpha$ bound. These independent results reinforce a consensus picture in which reionization is rapid and late. However, the combination of small-scale CMB, CMB lensing, and BAO data yields $\tau=0.094\pm0.011$, which is in $4\sigma$ tension with our Ly$\alpha$ bound. Non-standard reionization scenarios can reconcile some but not all constraints. Concordance is restored in alternative cosmological models, such as models with dynamical dark energy favoured by BAO, CMB, and SNe data. | [🔗 Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21069v1) |
| [Physical constraints on effective non-Hermitian systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21067v1) | Aaron Kleger, Rufus Boyack | 2025-08-28 | General AI | Interacting and open quantum systems can be formulated in terms of an effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian (NHH), however, there are important constraints that must be satisfied by the effective action and the associated Green's functions. One common approach to many-body non-Hermitian (NH) systems is to incorporate the anti-Hermitian part of the Hamiltonian directly in the Matsubara Green's function. Here, we show that such an approach is incompatible with the standard framework for systems with interactions. Furthermore, we furnish a consistent physical description for such systems by determining their distinction from conventional interacting physics, and find that they are described by pseudo-Hermitian quantum mechanics. Furthermore, we characterize the zero-temperature distribution functions within several frameworks for NH systems. As an application of our results, we consider the electromagnetic response of a NH quasiparticle Hamiltonian based on the (1+1)-dimensional NH Dirac model subject to various physical descriptions. | [🔗 Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21067v1) |
| [A Baryon and Lepton Number Violation Model Testable at the LHC](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21064v1) | Amit Bhoonah, Francis Burk, Da Liu, Tong Ou, Deepak Sathyan | 2025-08-28 | General AI | Proton decay experiments typically constrain baryon number violation to the scale of grand unified theories. From a phenomenological point of view, this makes direct probing of the associated new resonances, such as the X and Y bosons, out of reach for even the most optimistic future experiments. It has, however, been known that certain specific patterns of baryon and lepton number violation can suppress proton decay by multiple powers of the masses of the heavy resonances involved, opening the possibility that the observed limits on the proton lifetime are consistent with baryon number violating physics at energy scales much lower than that of grand unification. We construct an explicit example of such a model which violates baryon number by one unit, $\Delta \text{B} = -1$, and lepton number by three units, $\Delta \text{L} = -3$, and show that despite stringent limits on the predicted $p \rightarrow e^{+}/\mu^{+} \overline{\nu}\overline{\nu}$ mode from the Super-Kamiokande experiment, the masses of the newly introduced elementary particles can be $\mathcal{O}$(TeV). We identify interesting unique signatures of baryon number violation of this model that can be probed both with currently available LHC data and with the upcoming High-Luminosity LHC. We also present a scenario for low-scale baryogenesis within the framework of this model. | [🔗 Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21064v1) |
| [Prompt-to-Product: Generative Assembly via Bimanual Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21063v1) | Ruixuan Liu, Philip Huang, Ava Pun, Kangle Deng, Shobhit Aggarwal, Kevin Tang, Michelle Liu, Deva Ramanan, Jun-Yan Zhu, Jiaoyang Li, Changliu Liu | 2025-08-28 | General AI | Creating assembly products demands significant manual effort and expert knowledge in 1) designing the assembly and 2) constructing the product. This paper introduces Prompt-to-Product, an automated pipeline that generates real-world assembly products from natural language prompts. Specifically, we leverage LEGO bricks as the assembly platform and automate the process of creating brick assembly structures. Given the user design requirements, Prompt-to-Product generates physically buildable brick designs, and then leverages a bimanual robotic system to construct the real assembly products, bringing user imaginations into the real world. We conduct a comprehensive user study, and the results demonstrate that Prompt-to-Product significantly lowers the barrier and reduces manual effort in creating assembly products from imaginative ideas. | [🔗 Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21063v1) |
| [The algebraic structure of gravitational scrambling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21062v1) | Geoff Penington, Elisa Tabor | 2025-08-28 | General AI | We introduce a new algebraic framework to describe gravitational scrambling, including the semiclassical limit of any out-of-time-order correlation function that is built out of operator insertions separated by approximately the scrambling time. In two dimensions, the scrambling algebra, which we call a modular-twisted product, is defined in terms of two copies of the Leutheusser-Liu half-sided modular inclusion of von Neumann algebras; these describe early- and late-time operators respectively. In limits where the separation between insertions is taken to be either significantly greater or smaller than the scrambling time, the modular-twisted product reduces, respectively, to free- and tensor-product algebras that were previously studied in [arXiv:2209.10454]. In a sense, the modular-twisted product interpolates between these two products. Including the Hamiltonian in the scrambling algebra leads to a Type II$_\infty$ von Neumann algebra with finite renormalized entropies that interpolate between single-QES and multi-QES phases. We also describe how to generalize the modular-twisted product algebra to higher dimensions, including spatially localized boundary excitations. | [🔗 Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21062v1) |
| [Dynamics of the Fermion-Rotor System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21059v1) | Vazha Loladze, Takemichi Okui, David Tong | 2025-08-28 | General AI | We explore the dynamics of the fermion-rotor system, a simple impurity model in d=1+1 dimensions that consists of a collection of purely right-moving fermions interacting with a quantum mechanical rotor localised at the origin. This was first introduced by Polchinski as a toy model for monopole-fermion scattering and is surprisingly subtle, with ingoing and outgoing fermions carrying different quantum numbers. We show that the rotor acts as a twist operator in the low-energy theory, changing the quantum numbers of excitations that have previously passed through the origin to ensure scattering consistent with all symmetries.   We further show how generalisations of this model with multiple rotors and unequal charges can be viewed as a UV-completion of boundary states for chiral theories, including the well-studied 3450 model. We compute correlation functions between ingoing and outgoing fermions and show that fermions dressed with the rotor degree of freedom act as local operators and create single-particle states, generalising an earlier result obtained in a theory with a single rotor and equal charges. Finally, we point out a mod 2 anomaly in these models that descends from the Witten anomaly in 4d | [🔗 Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21059v1) |
| [Geometric Kernels of Proper Maps Between Non-Compact Surfaces](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21057v1) | Sumanta Das | 2025-08-28 | General AI | A map between connected $2$-manifolds has a geometric kernel if it sends a non-contractible simple loop to a null-homotopic loop. While every non-$\pi_1$-injective map between compact surfaces admits a geometric kernel, this generally fails for compact bordered or non-compact surfaces. In this paper, we use Brown's proper fundamental group to give a sufficient condition under which a degree-one map between non-compact surfaces admits a geometric kernel. Furthermore, we characterize conjugacy classes in the proper fundamental group and use this characterization to establish sufficient conditions for the existence of geometric kernels. | [🔗 Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21057v1) |
| [Altermagnetic Shastry-Sutherland fullerene networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21056v1) | Jiaqi Wu, Alaric Sanders, Rundong Yuan, Bo Peng | 2025-08-28 | General AI | Molecular building blocks provide a versatile platform for realising exotic quantum phases. Using charge neutral, pure carbon fullerene molecules as an example, we design altermagnetic C$_{40}$ monolayers in Shastry-Sutherland lattice. The resonance structure of one unpaired electron leads to an effective spin-1/2 cluster on both long sides of the molecule, which, after rotating into a 2D rutile-like crystal structure, forms altermagnetic ground state. We show $d$-wave spitting of the spin-polarised electronic band structure and strong chiral-split magnon bands. Most interestingly, the effective spin-1/2 clusters form the Shastry-Sutherland model with a rich phase diagram including altermagenti, quantum spin liquid, plaquette, and dimer phases, which can be easily accessed to via moderate bi-axial strains. Our findings present magnetic fullerene monolayers as a tunable platform for exotic quantum magnetism and spintronic applications. | [🔗 Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21056v1) |
| [Modern aspects of Markov chains: entropy, curvature and the cutoff
  phenomenon](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21055v1) | Justin Salez | 2025-08-28 | General AI | The cutoff phenomenon is an abrupt transition from out of equilibrium to equilibrium undergone by certain Markov processes in the limit where the size of the state space tends to infinity: instead of decaying gradually over time, their distance to equilibrium remains close to its maximal value for a while and suddenly drops to zero as the time parameter reaches a critical threshold. Discovered four decades ago in the context of card shuffling, this surprising phenomenon has since then been observed in a variety of models, from random walks on groups or complex networks to interacting particle systems. It is now believed to be universal among fast-mixing high-dimensional processes. Yet, current proofs are heavily model-dependent, and identifying the general conditions that trigger a cutoff remains one of the biggest challenges in the quantitative analysis of finite Markov chains. The purpose of these lecture notes is to provide a self-contained introduction to this fascinating question, and to describe its recently-uncovered relations with entropy, curvature and concentration. | [🔗 Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21055v1) |
| [Constraints on Logarithmic Model Extensions of Symmetric Teleparallel
  Gravity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21054v1) | Purnendu Karmakar, Sandeep Haridasu, Atsushi Nishizawa | 2025-08-28 | General AI | We address various cosmological phenomenologies in the symmetric teleparallel framework both in background and perturbation such as cosmic expansion, gravitational coupling constant, gravitational waves propagation. Focusing on logarithmic extensions of $f(Q)$ models, we performed Bayesian analysis using the most-recent cosmological data, DESI DR2, Pantheon+. We also utilized a compilation of redshift space distortions ($f \sigma_8$) dataset to constrain the growth of structures in each of the models modulated by the effective gravitational coupling. We find that our extended Logarithmic $f(Q)$ models are well-constrained by the current cosmological data and are able to describe the late-time cosmic acceleration. The inverse Logarithmic model we introduce is also able to accommodate a phantom-like dark energy equation of state at late times, which is consistent with the recent DESI DR2 observations. We report explicitly predictions for the effective gravitational coupling ($\mu$), and the amplitude damping parameter of gravitational wave ($\nu$) solely based on the background data, which can be tested against future observations. While the two Log-based extensions we have introduced here perform equivalently on the background level, they provide contrasting predictions for the evolution of effective Gravitational constant and propagation of gravitational waves, which should be constrained against the future perturbation data. | [🔗 Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21054v1) |
| [Enabling Equitable Access to Trustworthy Financial Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21051v1) | William Jurayj, Nils Holzenberger, Benjamin Van Durme | 2025-08-28 | General AI | According to the United States Internal Revenue Service, ''the average American spends $\$270$ and 13 hours filing their taxes''. Even beyond the U.S., tax filing requires complex reasoning, combining application of overlapping rules with numerical calculations. Because errors can incur costly penalties, any automated system must deliver high accuracy and auditability, making modern large language models (LLMs) poorly suited for this task. We propose an approach that integrates LLMs with a symbolic solver to calculate tax obligations. We evaluate variants of this system on the challenging StAtutory Reasoning Assessment (SARA) dataset, and include a novel method for estimating the cost of deploying such a system based on real-world penalties for tax errors. We further show how combining up-front translation of plain-text rules into formal logic programs, combined with intelligently retrieved exemplars for formal case representations, can dramatically improve performance on this task and reduce costs to well below real-world averages. Our results demonstrate the promise and economic feasibility of neuro-symbolic architectures for increasing equitable access to reliable tax assistance. | [🔗 Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21051v1) |
| [Re-Representation in Sentential Relation Extraction with Sequence
  Routing Algorithm](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21049v1) | Ramazan Ali Bahrami, Ramin Yahyapour | 2025-08-28 | General AI | Sentential relation extraction (RE) is an important task in natural language processing (NLP). In this paper we propose to do sentential RE with dynamic routing in capsules. We first show that the proposed approach outperform state of the art on common sentential relation extraction datasets Tacred, Tacredrev, Retacred, and Conll04. We then investigate potential reasons for its good performance on the mentioned datasets, and yet low performance on another similar, yet larger sentential RE dataset, Wikidata. As such, we identify noise in Wikidata labels as one of the reasons that can hinder performance. Additionally, we show associativity of better performance with better re-representation, a term from neuroscience referred to change of representation in human brain to improve the match at comparison time. As example, in the given analogous terms King:Queen::Man:Woman, at comparison time, and as a result of re-representation, the similarity between related head terms (King,Man), and tail terms (Queen,Woman) increases. As such, our observation show that our proposed model can do re-representation better than the vanilla model compared with. To that end, beside noise in the labels of the distantly supervised RE datasets, we propose re-representation as a challenge in sentential RE. | [🔗 Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21049v1) |

  via Area-minimizing Submanifolds](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21045v1) | Zhenhua Liu | 2025-08-28 | General AI | The Hasse principle in number theory states that information about integral solutions to Diophantine equations can be pieced together from real solutions and solutions modulo prime powers. We show that the Hasse principle holds for area-minimizing submanifolds: information about area-minimizing submanifolds in integral homology can be fully recovered from those in real homology and mod $n$ homology for all $n\in \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 2}.$ As a consequence we derive several surprising conclusions, including: area-minimizing submanifolds in mod $n$ homology are asymptotically much smoother than expected and area-minimizing submanifolds are not generically calibrated. We conjecture that the Hasse principle holds for all geometric variational problems that can be formulated on chain space over different coeffiicients, e.g., Almgren-Pitts min-max, mean curvature flow, Song's spherical Plateau problem, minimizers of elliptic and other general functionals, etc. | [🔗 Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21045v1) |

  metallicity: uniform progenitor parameter space and persistently low ejecta
  masses, but subtype diversity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21042v1) | D. Souropanis, E. Zapartas, T. Pessi, M. Briel, M. Renzo, C. P. Gutiérrez, J. J. Andrews, S. Gossage, M. U. Kruckow, C. Liotine, P. M. Srivastava, E. Teng | 2025-08-28 | General AI | Stripped-envelope supernovae (SESNe) originate from massive stars that lose their envelopes through binary interactions or stellar winds. The connection between SESN subtypes and their progenitors remains poorly understood, as does the influence of initial mass, binarity, explodability, and metallicity on their evolutionary pathways, relative rates, ejecta masses, and progenitor ages. Here, we investigate these properties across a wide metallicity range (0.01-2 $Z_{\odot}$) using POSYDON, a state-of-the-art population synthesis code that incorporates detailed single- and binary-star model grids. We find that the common-envelope channel contributes less than 6% of SESNe, since unstable mass transfer is found less frequent than previously thought and rarely leads to CE survival when envelope binding energies are computed from detailed stellar models. The secondary channel accounts for less than 11%, while the vast majority of SESNe originate from primary stars in binaries undergoing stable mass-transfer episodes. These interactions maintain a largely metallicity-independent SESN parameter space, making the overall SESN rate almost insensitive to metallicity. In contrast, subtype fractions exhibit strong metallicity dependence, though their exact values remain affected by classification thresholds. The age distributions and therefore the progenitor masses of different SESN types also vary significantly with metallicity, revealing metallicity-dependent trends that can be tested observationally. Predicted SESN ejecta masses remain nearly constant across metallicity, in contrast to single-star models, and fall within observed ranges. Future transient surveys, combined with statistical environmental studies that constrain metallicity dependence, will provide decisive tests of these predictions and of the dominant role of binary interactions in shaping SESNe. | [🔗 Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21042v1) |
| [FW-GAN: Frequency-Driven Handwriting Synthesis with Wave-Modulated MLP
  Generator](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21040v1) | Huynh Tong Dang Khoa, Dang Hoai Nam, Vo Nguyen Le Duy | 2025-08-28 | General AI | Labeled handwriting data is often scarce, limiting the effectiveness of recognition systems that require diverse, style-consistent training samples. Handwriting synthesis offers a promising solution by generating artificial data to augment training. However, current methods face two major limitations. First, most are built on conventional convolutional architectures, which struggle to model long-range dependencies and complex stroke patterns. Second, they largely ignore the crucial role of frequency information, which is essential for capturing fine-grained stylistic and structural details in handwriting. To address these challenges, we propose FW-GAN, a one-shot handwriting synthesis framework that generates realistic, writer-consistent text from a single example. Our generator integrates a phase-aware Wave-MLP to better capture spatial relationships while preserving subtle stylistic cues. We further introduce a frequency-guided discriminator that leverages high-frequency components to enhance the authenticity detection of generated samples. Additionally, we introduce a novel Frequency Distribution Loss that aligns the frequency characteristics of synthetic and real handwriting, thereby enhancing visual fidelity. Experiments on Vietnamese and English handwriting datasets demonstrate that FW-GAN generates high-quality, style-consistent handwriting, making it a valuable tool for augmenting data in low-resource handwriting recognition (HTR) pipelines.

| [Far from equilibrium attractors in phase space](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21039v1) | Michał Spaliński | 2025-08-28 | General AI | We clarify the connection between attractor solutions known from studies of Bjorken flow in conformal models of relativistic fluid dynamics and the more general description of attractors as submanifolds in phase space. We show how to determine sections of the attractor on slices of constant proper time, and point out that in conformal models one may choose a parametrisation of the extended phase space such that the intersection of the attractor with a slice of constant proper time is the same on all slices. In consequence, it is possibleto project these intersections and one finds that the result reproduces the attractor solution. This projection allows for an expressive picture of hydrodynamisation, but the attractor can be equally well described without taking advantage of this convenience. An immediate implication of these observations is that conformal symmetry does not play a significant role in the emergence of early-time attraction. We illustrate this by describing the hydrodynamic attractor in a simple model where conformal symmetry is broken by the equation of state. Our findings can be applied to studies of hydrodynamic attractors in more general situations, also beyond the context of quark-gluon plasma dynamics. | [🔗 Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21039v1) |
| [On the Theoretical Limitations of Embedding-Based Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21038v1) | Orion Weller, Michael Boratko, Iftekhar Naim, Jinhyuk Lee | 2025-08-28 | General AI | Vector embeddings have been tasked with an ever-increasing set of retrieval tasks over the years, with a nascent rise in using them for reasoning, instruction-following, coding, and more. These new benchmarks push embeddings to work for any query and any notion of relevance that could be given. While prior works have pointed out theoretical limitations of vector embeddings, there is a common assumption that these difficulties are exclusively due to unrealistic queries, and those that are not can be overcome with better training data and larger models. In this work, we demonstrate that we may encounter these theoretical limitations in realistic settings with extremely simple queries. We connect known results in learning theory, showing that the number of top-k subsets of documents capable of being returned as the result of some query is limited by the dimension of the embedding. We empirically show that this holds true even if we restrict to k=2, and directly optimize on the test set with free parameterized embeddings. We then create a realistic dataset called LIMIT that stress tests models based on these theoretical results, and observe that even state-of-the-art models fail on this dataset despite the simple nature of the task. Our work shows the limits of embedding models under the existing single vector paradigm and calls for future research to develop methods that can resolve this fundamental limitation. | [🔗 Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21038v1) |

Bhupal Dev | 2025-08-28 | General AI | We propose heavy decaying dark matter (DM) as a new probe of the cosmic neutrino background (C$\nu$B). Heavy DM, with mass $\gtrsim 10^9$ GeV, decaying into neutrinos can be a new source of ultra-high-energy (UHE) neutrinos. Including this contribution along with the measured astrophysical and predicted cosmogenic neutrino fluxes, we study the scattering of UHE neutrinos with the C$\nu$B via standard weak interactions mediated by the $Z$-boson. We solve the complete neutrino transport equation, taking into account both absorption and reinjection effects, to calculate the expected spectrum of UHE neutrino flux at future neutrino telescopes, such as IceCube-Gen2 Radio. We argue that such observations can be used to probe the C$\nu$B properties, and in particular, local C$\nu$B clustering. We find that, depending on the absolute neutrino mass and the DM mass and lifetime, a local C$\nu$B overdensity $\gtrsim 10^6$ can be probed at IceCube-Gen2 Radio within 10 years of data taking. | [🔗 Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21034v1) |
| [Introducing the Quantum Economic Advantage Online Calculator](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21031v1) | Frederick Mejia, Hans Gundlach, Jayson Lynch, Carl Dukatz, Andrew Lucas, Eleanor Crane, Prashant Shukla, Neil Thompson | 2025-08-28 | General AI | Developing a systematic view of where quantum computers will outperform classical ones is important for researchers, policy makers and business leaders. But developing such a view is challenging because quantum advantage analyses depend not only on algorithm properties, but also on a host of technical characteristics (error correction, gate speeds, etc.). Because various analyses make different assumptions about these technical characteristics, it can be challenging to make comparisons across them. In this paper, we introduce an open-access web-tool designed to make such comparisons easy. Built on the framework introduced by Choi, Moses, and Thompson (2023), it calculates when quantum systems will outperform classical computers for a given algorithmic problem. These estimates can be easily updated based on various assumptions for error correction, overhead, and connectivity. Different hardware roadmaps can also be used and algorithm running times can be customized to particular applications. It can currently be accessed at https://futuretech.mit.edu/quantum-economic-advantage-calculator.   This integrated prediction tool also allows us to explore which technical factors are most important for quantum ``economic" advantage (outperforming on a cost-equivalent basis). Overall, we find that for some algorithms (e.g. Shor's) the timing of advantage is quite robust, whereas for others (e.g. Grover's) it is contingent, with numerous technical characteristics substantially impacting these dates. In the paper, we discuss both why this occurs and what we can learn from it. | [🔗 Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21031v1) |

Walters | 2025-08-28 | General AI | Rare-event search experiments require construction materials with high radiopurity to minimise background contributions. Thanks to its high mechanical strength, low density, machinability, and commercial availability in relatively radio-pure forms, titanium is a suitable material for structural elements in rare event searches. To remove surface deposits on materials used, a chemical etching stage is usually performed. However, the chemical resistance of titanium means that, conventionally, such etching is done with hydrofluoric acid. Hydrofluoric acid presents serious health risks to users, and such hazards are compounded in the case of construction in deep underground laboratories. An alternative chemical etching using sulphuric acid is presented. This is demonstrated to etch titanium, removing 3.7 $\mu$m of material from the surface over the course of 20 hours. Scanning electron microscopy with back-scattered electron spectroscopy was used to study the surface and contamination of the titanium, demonstrating the removal of surface contaminants after etching. The proposed method is a potential alternative to those currently employed. | [🔗 Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21029v1) |

  the Type Ic Supernova 2012fh](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21027v1) | Benjamin F. Williams, Emmanouil Zapartas, Ori D. Fox, K. Azalee Bostroem, Jianing Su, Brad Koplitz, Schuyler D. Van Dyk, Maria R. Drout, Dimitris Souropanis, Dan Milisavljevic, Stuart D. Ryder, Selma E. de Mink, Nathan Smith, Andrew Dolphin, Alexei V. Filippenko, Jeff J. Andrews, Max M. Briel, Seth Gossage, Matthias U. Kruckow, Camille Liotine, Philipp M. Srivastava, Elizabeth Teng | 2025-08-28 | General AI | Current explanations of the mass-loss mechanism for stripped-envelope supernovae remain divided between single and binary progenitor systems. Here we obtain deep ultraviolet (UV) imaging with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) of the Type Ic SN 2012fh to search for the presence of a surviving companion star to the progenitor. We synthesize these observations with archival HST imaging, ground-based spectroscopy, and previous analyses from the literature to provide three independent constraints on the progenitor system. We fit the color-magnitude diagram of the surrounding population to constrain the most likely age of the system to be $<20$ Myr. Analysis of spectra of SN 2012fh provide an estimate of the He core mass of the progenitor star, $>5.6$ M$_{\odot}$. We analyze deep HST images at the precise location after the SN faded to constrain the luminosity of any remaining main-sequence binary companion to be $\log(L/L_{\odot}) \lesssim 3.35$. Combining observational constraints with current binary population synthesis models excludes the presence of a faint stellar companion to SN 2012fh at the $\lesssim10\%$ level. The progenitor was therefore either effectively isolated at the time of explosion or orbited by a black-hole companion. The latter scenario dominates if we only consider models that produce successful supernovae. | [🔗 Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21027v1) |
| [A first-order condition for discrete-time distribution steering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21026v1) | Alberto Domínguez Corella, David González-Sánchez | 2025-08-28 | General AI | We study a class of distribution-steering problems from a variational point of view. Under some differentiability assumptions, we derive necessary conditions for optimal Markov policies in the spirit of the Lagrange multiplier approach.

| [Pivotal inference for linear predictions in stationary processes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21025v1) | Holger Dette, Sebastian Kühnert | 2025-08-28 | General AI | In this paper we develop pivotal inference for the final (FPE) and relative final prediction error (RFPE) of linear forecasts in stationary processes. Our approach is based on a novel self-normalizing technique and avoids the estimation of the asymptotic variances of the empirical autocovariances. We provide pivotal confidence intervals for the (R)FPE, develop estimates for the minimal order of a linear prediction that is required to obtain a prespecified forecasting accuracy and also propose (pivotal) statistical tests for the hypotheses that the (R)FPE exceeds a given threshold. Additionally, we provide new (pivotal) inference tools for the partial autocorrelation, which do not require the assumption of an autoregressive process. | [🔗 Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21025v1) |

  induced by oxygen getter assisted thermal annealing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21023v1) | Chenyang Yin, Lei Cao, Xue Bai, Suqin He, Hengbo Zhang, Tomas Duchon, Felix Gunkel, Yunxia Zhou, Mao Wang, Anton Kaus, Janghyun Jo, Rafal E. Dunin-Borkowski, Shengqiang Zhou, Thomas Brückel, Oleg Petracic | 2025-08-28 | General AI | Oxygen vacancies play a crucial role in controlling the physical properties of complex oxides. In La0.7Sr0.3MnO3-{\delta}, the topotactic phase transition from Perovskite (PV) to Brownmillerite (BM) can be triggered e.g. via oxygen removal during thermal annealing. Here we report on a very efficient thermal vacuum annealing method using aluminum as an oxygen getter material. The topotactic phase transition is characterized by X-ray Diffraction which confirms a successful transition from PV to BM in La0.7Sr0.3MnO3-{\delta} thin films grown via physical vapor deposition. The efficiency of this method is confirmed using La0.7Sr0.3MnO3-{\delta} micron-sized bulk powder. The accompanying transition from the original Ferromagnetic (FM) to an Antiferromagnetic (AF) state and the simultaneous transition from a metallic to an insulating state is characterized using Superconducting Quantum Interference Device (SQUID)-magnetometry and Alternating Current (AC) resistivity measurements, respectively. The near surface manganese oxidation states are probed by synchrotron X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy. Moreover, X-ray Reflectivity, Atomic Force Microscopy and Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy reveal surface segregation and cation redistribution during the oxygen getter assisted annealing process. | [🔗 Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21023v1) |
