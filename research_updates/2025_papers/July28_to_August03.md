| [Gaussian Variation Field Diffusion for High-fidelity Video-to-4D
  Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23785v1) | Bowen Zhang, Sicheng Xu, Chuxin Wang, Jiaolong Yang, Feng Zhao, Dong Chen, Baining Guo | 2025-07-31 | LLM, Multimodal AI, Diffusion Models | In this paper, we present a novel framework for video-to-4D generation that creates high-quality dynamic 3D content from single video inputs. Direct 4D diffusion modeling is extremely challenging due to costly data construction and the high-dimensional nature of jointly representing 3D shape, appearance, and motion. We address these challenges by introducing a Direct 4DMesh-to-GS Variation Field VAE that directly encodes canonical Gaussian Splats (GS) and their temporal variations from 3D animation data without per-instance fitting, and compresses high-dimensional animations into a compact latent space. Building upon this efficient representation, we train a Gaussian Variation Field diffusion model with temporal-aware Diffusion Transformer conditioned on input videos and canonical GS. Trained on carefully-curated animatable 3D objects from the Objaverse dataset, our model demonstrates superior generation quality compared to existing methods. It also exhibits remarkable generalization to in-the-wild video inputs despite being trained exclusively on synthetic data, paving the way for generating high-quality animated 3D content.

| [Phi-Ground Tech Report: Advancing Perception in GUI Grounding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23779v1) | Miaosen Zhang, Ziqiang Xu, Jialiang Zhu, Qi Dai, Kai Qiu, Yifan Yang, Chong Luo, Tianyi Chen, Justin Wagle, Tim Franklin, Baining Guo | 2025-07-31 | LLM, Multimodal AI | With the development of multimodal reasoning models, Computer Use Agents (CUAs), akin to Jarvis from \textit{"Iron Man"}, are becoming a reality. GUI grounding is a core component for CUAs to execute actual actions, similar to mechanical control in robotics, and it directly leads to the success or failure of the system. It determines actions such as clicking and typing, as well as related parameters like the coordinates for clicks. Current end-to-end grounding models still achieve less than 65\% accuracy on challenging benchmarks like ScreenSpot-pro and UI-Vision, indicating they are far from being ready for deployment. % , as a single misclick can result in unacceptable consequences. In this work, we conduct an empirical study on the training of grounding models, examining details from data collection to model training. Ultimately, we developed the \textbf{Phi-Ground} model family, which achieves state-of-the-art performance across all five grounding benchmarks for models under $10B$ parameters in agent settings. In the end-to-end model setting, our model still achieves SOTA results with scores of \textit{\textbf{43.2}} on ScreenSpot-pro and \textit{\textbf{27.2}} on UI-Vision. We believe that the various details discussed in this paper, along with our successes and failures, not only clarify the construction of grounding models but also benefit other perception tasks.

| [Half-Physics: Enabling Kinematic 3D Human Model with Physical
  Interactions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23778v1) | Li Siyao, Yao Feng, Omid Tehari, Chen Change Loy, Michael J. Black | 2025-07-31 | RLHF | While current general-purpose 3D human models (e.g., SMPL-X) efficiently represent accurate human shape and pose, they lacks the ability to physically interact with the environment due to the kinematic nature. As a result, kinematic-based interaction models often suffer from issues such as interpenetration and unrealistic object dynamics. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel approach that embeds SMPL-X into a tangible entity capable of dynamic physical interactions with its surroundings. Specifically, we propose a "half-physics" mechanism that transforms 3D kinematic motion into a physics simulation. Our approach maintains kinematic control over inherent SMPL-X poses while ensuring physically plausible interactions with scenes and objects, effectively eliminating penetration and unrealistic object dynamics. Unlike reinforcement learning-based methods, which demand extensive and complex training, our half-physics method is learning-free and generalizes to any body shape and motion; meanwhile, it operates in real time. Moreover, it preserves the fidelity of the original kinematic motion while seamlessly integrating physical interactions | [🔗 Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23778v1) |

| [SUB: Benchmarking CBM Generalization via Synthetic Attribute
  Substitutions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23784v1) | Jessica Bader, Leander Girrbach, Stephan Alaniz, Zeynep Akata | 2025-07-31 | Responsible AI, Model Evaluation, Diffusion Models, Training & Evaluation | Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) and other concept-based interpretable models show great promise for making AI applications more transparent, which is essential in fields like medicine. Despite their success, we demonstrate that CBMs struggle to reliably identify the correct concepts under distribution shifts. To assess the robustness of CBMs to concept variations, we introduce SUB: a fine-grained image and concept benchmark containing 38,400 synthetic images based on the CUB dataset. To create SUB, we select a CUB subset of 33 bird classes and 45 concepts to generate images which substitute a specific concept, such as wing color or belly pattern. We introduce a novel Tied Diffusion Guidance (TDG) method to precisely control generated images, where noise sharing for two parallel denoising processes ensures that both the correct bird class and the correct attribute are generated. This novel benchmark enables rigorous evaluation of CBMs and similar interpretable models, contributing to the development of more robust methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/ExplainableML/sub and the dataset at http://huggingface.co/datasets/Jessica-bader/SUB. | [🔗 Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23784v1) |

| [Scale-anomaly-induced confining pressure within hadrons](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23786v1) | Daisuke Fujii, Mitsuru Tanaka | 2025-07-31 | General AI | The effect of the QCD scale anomaly on the internal pressure distribution of hadrons is studied based on the trace-traceless decomposition of the energy-momentum tensor. Using recent model-independent results of gravitational form factors as input, the pressure distributions of both pions and nucleons are analyzed in the instant form and the light-front form. It is found that, in all cases, the scale anomaly dominantly generates the confining pressure. This result suggests that the phenomenon is a universal feature, independent of models, types of hadrons, and the choice of form. | [🔗 Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23786v1) |
| [Amplitude amplification and estimation require inverses](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23787v1) | Ewin Tang, John Wright | 2025-07-31 | General AI | We prove that the generic quantum speedups for brute-force search and counting only hold when the process we apply them to can be efficiently inverted. The algorithms speeding up these problems, amplitude amplification and amplitude estimation, assume the ability to apply a state preparation unitary $U$ and its inverse $U^\dagger$; we give problem instances based on trace estimation where no algorithm which uses only $U$ beats the naive, quadratically slower approach. Our proof of this is simple and goes through the compressed oracle method introduced by Zhandry. Since these two subroutines are responsible for the ubiquity of the quadratic "Grover" speedup in quantum algorithms, our result explains why such speedups are far harder to come by in the settings of quantum learning, metrology, and sensing. In these settings, $U$ models the evolution of an experimental system, so implementing $U^\dagger$ can be much harder -- tantamount to reversing time within the system. Our result suggests a dichotomy: without inverse access, quantum speedups are scarce; with it, quantum speedups abound. | [🔗 Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23787v1) |
| [MonoFusion: Sparse-View 4D Reconstruction via Monocular Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23782v1) | Zihan Wang, Jeff Tan, Tarasha Khurana, Neehar Peri, Deva Ramanan | 2025-07-31 | General AI | We address the problem of dynamic scene reconstruction from sparse-view videos. Prior work often requires dense multi-view captures with hundreds of calibrated cameras (e.g. Panoptic Studio). Such multi-view setups are prohibitively expensive to build and cannot capture diverse scenes in-the-wild. In contrast, we aim to reconstruct dynamic human behaviors, such as repairing a bike or dancing, from a small set of sparse-view cameras with complete scene coverage (e.g. four equidistant inward-facing static cameras). We find that dense multi-view reconstruction methods struggle to adapt to this sparse-view setup due to limited overlap between viewpoints. To address these limitations, we carefully align independent monocular reconstructions of each camera to produce time- and view-consistent dynamic scene reconstructions. Extensive experiments on PanopticStudio and Ego-Exo4D demonstrate that our method achieves higher quality reconstructions than prior art, particularly when rendering novel views.

| [Projected branes as platforms for crystalline, superconducting, and
  higher-order topological phases](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23783v1) | Archisman Panigrahi, Bitan Roy | 2025-07-31 | General AI | Projected branes are constituted by only a small subset of sites of a higher-dimensional crystal, otherwise placed on a hyperplane oriented at an irrational or a rational slope therein, for which the effective Hamiltonian is constructed by systematically integrating out the sites of the parent lattice that fall outside such branes [Commun. Phys. 5, 230 (2022)]. Specifically, when such a brane is constructed from a square lattice, it gives rise to an aperiodic Fibonacci quasi-crystal or its rational approximant in one dimension. In this work, starting from square lattice-based models for topological crystalline insulators, protected by the discrete four-fold rotational ($C_4$) symmetry, we show that the resulting one-dimensional projected topological branes encode all the salient signatures of such phases in terms of robust endpoint zero-energy modes, quantized local topological markers, and mid-gap modes bound to dislocation lattice defects, despite such linear branes being devoid of the $C_4$ symmetry of the original lattice. Furthermore, we show that such branes can also feature all the hallmarks of two-dimensional strong and weak topological superconductors through Majorana zero-energy bound states residing near their endpoints and at the core of dislocation lattice defects, besides possessing suitable quantized local topological markers. Finally, we showcase a successful incarnation of a square lattice-based second-order topological insulator with the characteristic corner-localized zero modes in its geometric descendant one-dimensional quasi-crystalline or crystalline branes that feature a quantized localizer index and endpoint zero-energy modes only when one of its end points passes through a corner of the parent crystal. Possible designer quantum and meta material-based platforms to experimentally harness our theoretically proposed topological branes are discussed. | [🔗 Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23783v1) |
| [Graded Unitarity in the SCFT/VOA Correspondence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23781v1) | Arash Arabi Ardehali, Christopher Beem, Madalena Lemos, Leonardo Rastelli | 2025-07-31 | General AI | Vertex algebras that arise from four-dimensional, $\mathcal{N}=2$ superconformal field theories inherit a collection of novel structural properties from their four-dimensional ancestors. Crucially, when the parent SCFT is unitary, the corresponding vertex algebra is not unitary in the conventional sense. In this paper, we motivate and define a generalized notion of unitarity for vertex algebras that we call \emph{graded unitarity}, and which captures the consequences of four-dimensional unitarity under this correspondence. We also take the first steps towards a classification program for graded-unitary vertex algebras whose underlying vertex algebras are Virasoro or affine Kac--Moody vertex algebras. Remarkably, under certain natural assumptions about the $\mathfrak{R}$-filtration for these vertex algebras, we show that only the $(2,p)$ central charges for Virasoro VOAs and boundary admissible levels for $\mathfrak{sl}_2$ and $\mathfrak{sl}_3$ Kac--Moody vertex algebras can possibly be compatible with graded unitarity. These are precisely the cases of these vertex algebras that are known to arise from four dimensions. | [🔗 Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23781v1) |
| [Two-dimensional Disordered Projected Branes: Stability and Quantum
  Criticality via Dimensional Reduction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23780v1) | Alexander C. Tyner, Vladimir Juricic, Bitan Roy | 2025-07-31 | General AI | The interplay of disorder and dimensionality governs the emergence and stability of electronic phases in quantum materials and quantum phase transitions among them. While three-dimensional (3D) dirty Fermi liquids and Weyl semimetals support robust metallic states, undergoing disorder-driven Anderson localization transitions at strong disorder and the later ones exhibiting additional semimetal-to-metal transition at moderate disorder, conventional two-dimensional (2D) non-interacting systems localize for arbitrarily weak disorder. Here, we show that 2D disordered projected branes, constructed by systematically integrating out degrees of freedom from a 3D cubic lattice via the Schur decomposition, faithfully reproduce the full quantum phase diagram of their 3D parent systems. Using large-scale exact diagonalization and kernel polynomial method, we numerically demonstrate that 2D projected branes host stable metallic and semimetallic phases. Remarkably, the critical exponents governing the semimetal-to-metal and metal-insulator transitions on such 2D projected branes are sufficiently close to those of their 3D counterparts. Our findings thus establish 2D projected branes as genuine quantum holographic images of their higher-dimensional disordered parent crystals, supporting stable semimetallic and metallic phases that are otherwise inaccessible in conventional 2D lattices. Finally, we point to experimentally accessible metamaterial platforms, most notably the photonic lattices with tunable refractive-index disorder, as promising systems to realize and probe these phenomena. | [🔗 Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23780v1) |
