| [RynnVLA-002: A Unified Vision-Language-Action and World Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17502v1) | Jun Cen, Siteng Huang, Yuqian Yuan, Hangjie Yuan, Chaohui Yu, Yuming Jiang, Jiayan Guo, Kehan Li, Hao Luo, Fan Wang, Xin Li, Deli Zhao, Hao Chen | 2025-11-21 | Diffusion Models, Multimodal AI | We introduce RynnVLA-002, a unified Vision-Language-Action (VLA) and world model. The world model leverages action and visual inputs to predict future image states, learning the underlying physics of the environment to refine action generation. Conversely, the VLA model produces subsequent actions from image observations, enhancing visual understanding and supporting the world model's image generation. The unified framework of RynnVLA-002 enables joint learning of environmental dynamics and action planning. Our experiments show that RynnVLA-002 surpasses individual VLA and world models, demonstrating their mutual enhancement. We evaluate RynnVLA-002 in both simulation and real-world robot tasks. RynnVLA-002 achieves 97.4% success rate on the LIBERO simulation benchmark without pretraining, while in real-world LeRobot experiments, its integrated world model boosts the overall success rate by 50%. | [🔗 Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17502v1) |
| [MDG: Masked Denoising Generation for Multi-Agent Behavior Modeling in Traffic Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17496v1) | Zhiyu Huang, Zewei Zhou, Tianhui Cai, Yun Zhang, Jiaqi Ma | 2025-11-21 | Diffusion Models | Modeling realistic and interactive multi-agent behavior is critical to autonomous driving and traffic simulation. However, existing diffusion and autoregressive approaches are limited by iterative sampling, sequential decoding, or task-specific designs, which hinder efficiency and reuse. We propose Masked Denoising Generation (MDG), a unified generative framework that reformulates multi-agent behavior modeling as the reconstruction of independently noised spatiotemporal tensors. Instead of relying on diffusion time steps or discrete tokenization, MDG applies continuous, per-agent and per-timestep noise masks that enable localized denoising and controllable trajectory generation in a single or few forward passes. This mask-driven formulation generalizes across open-loop prediction, closed-loop simulation, motion planning, and conditional generation within one model. Trained on large-scale real-world driving datasets, MDG achieves competitive closed-loop performance on the Waymo Sim Agents and nuPlan Planning benchmarks, while providing efficient, consistent, and controllable open-loop multi-agent trajectory generation. These results position MDG as a simple yet versatile paradigm for multi-agent behavior modeling. | [🔗 Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17496v1) |
| [EvDiff: High Quality Video with an Event Camera](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17492v1) | Weilun Li, Lei Sun, Ruixi Gao, Qi Jiang, Yuqin Ma, Kaiwei Wang, Ming-Hsuan Yang, Luc Van Gool, Danda Pani Paudel | 2025-11-21 | Diffusion Models, Multimodal AI | As neuromorphic sensors, event cameras asynchronously record changes in brightness as streams of sparse events with the advantages of high temporal resolution and high dynamic range. Reconstructing intensity images from events is a highly ill-posed task due to the inherent ambiguity of absolute brightness. Early methods generally follow an end-to-end regression paradigm, directly mapping events to intensity frames in a deterministic manner. While effective to some extent, these approaches often yield perceptually inferior results and struggle to scale up in model capacity and training data. In this work, we propose EvDiff, an event-based diffusion model that follows a surrogate training framework to produce high-quality videos. To reduce the heavy computational cost of high-frame-rate video generation, we design an event-based diffusion model that performs only a single forward diffusion step, equipped with a temporally consistent EvEncoder. Furthermore, our novel Surrogate Training Framework eliminates the dependence on paired event-image datasets, allowing the model to leverage large-scale image datasets for higher capacity. The proposed EvDiff is capable of generating high-quality colorful videos solely from monochromatic event streams. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our method strikes a sweet spot between fidelity and realism, outperforming existing approaches on both pixel-level and perceptual metrics. | [🔗 Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17492v1) |
| [Radar2Shape: 3D Shape Reconstruction from High-Frequency Radar using Multiresolution Signed Distance Functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17484v1) | Neel Sortur, Justin Goodwin, Purvik Patel, Luis Enrique Martinez, Tzofi Klinghoffer, Rajmonda S. Caceres, Robin Walters | 2025-11-21 | Diffusion Models | Determining the shape of 3D objects from high-frequency radar signals is analytically complex but critical for commercial and aerospace applications. Previous deep learning methods have been applied to radar modeling; however, they often fail to represent arbitrary shapes or have difficulty with real-world radar signals which are collected over limited viewing angles. Existing methods in optical 3D reconstruction can generate arbitrary shapes from limited camera views, but struggle when they naively treat the radar signal as a camera view. In this work, we present Radar2Shape, a denoising diffusion model that handles a partially observable radar signal for 3D reconstruction by correlating its frequencies with multiresolution shape features. Our method consists of a two-stage approach: first, Radar2Shape learns a regularized latent space with hierarchical resolutions of shape features, and second, it diffuses into this latent space by conditioning on the frequencies of the radar signal in an analogous coarse-to-fine manner. We demonstrate that Radar2Shape can successfully reconstruct arbitrary 3D shapes even from partially-observed radar signals, and we show robust generalization to two different simulation methods and real-world data. Additionally, we release two synthetic benchmark datasets to encourage future research in the high-frequency radar domain so that models like Radar2Shape can safely be adapted into real-world radar systems. | [🔗 Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17484v1) |
| [Counterfactual World Models via Digital Twin-conditioned Video Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17481v1) | Yiqing Shen, Aiza Maksutova, Chenjia Li, Mathias Unberath | 2025-11-21 | Diffusion Models, Multimodal AI | World models learn to predict the temporal evolution of visual observations given a control signal, potentially enabling agents to reason about environments through forward simulation. Because of the focus on forward simulation, current world models generate predictions based on factual observations. For many emerging applications, such as comprehensive evaluations of physical AI behavior under varying conditions, the ability of world models to answer counterfactual queries, such as "what would happen if this object was removed?", is of increasing importance. We formalize counterfactual world models that additionally take interventions as explicit inputs, predicting temporal sequences under hypothetical modifications to observed scene properties. Traditional world models operate directly on entangled pixel-space representations where object properties and relationships cannot be selectively modified. This modeling choice prevents targeted interventions on specific scene properties. We introduce CWMDT, a framework to overcome those limitations, turning standard video diffusion models into effective counterfactual world models. First, CWMDT constructs digital twins of observed scenes to explicitly encode objects and their relationships, represented as structured text. Second, CWMDT applies large language models to reason over these representations and predict how a counterfactual intervention propagates through time to alter the observed scene. Third, CWMDT conditions a video diffusion model with the modified representation to generate counterfactual visual sequences. Evaluations on two benchmarks show that the CWMDT approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, suggesting that alternative representations of videos, such as the digital twins considered here, offer powerful control signals for video forward simulation-based world models. | [🔗 Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17481v1) |
| [Planning with Sketch-Guided Verification for Physics-Aware Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17450v1) | Yidong Huang, Zun Wang, Han Lin, Dong-Ki Kim, Shayegan Omidshafiei, Jaehong Yoon, Yue Zhang, Mohit Bansal | 2025-11-21 | Diffusion Models, Scaling Laws, RLHF, Multimodal AI | Recent video generation approaches increasingly rely on planning intermediate control signals such as object trajectories to improve temporal coherence and motion fidelity. However, these methods mostly employ single-shot plans that are typically limited to simple motions, or iterative refinement which requires multiple calls to the video generator, incuring high computational cost. To overcome these limitations, we propose SketchVerify, a training-free, sketch-verification-based planning framework that improves motion planning quality with more dynamically coherent trajectories (i.e., physically plausible and instruction-consistent motions) prior to full video generation by introducing a test-time sampling and verification loop. Given a prompt and a reference image, our method predicts multiple candidate motion plans and ranks them using a vision-language verifier that jointly evaluates semantic alignment with the instruction and physical plausibility. To efficiently score candidate motion plans, we render each trajectory as a lightweight video sketch by compositing objects over a static background, which bypasses the need for expensive, repeated diffusion-based synthesis while achieving comparable performance. We iteratively refine the motion plan until a satisfactory one is identified, which is then passed to the trajectory-conditioned generator for final synthesis. Experiments on WorldModelBench and PhyWorldBench demonstrate that our method significantly improves motion quality, physical realism, and long-term consistency compared to competitive baselines while being substantially more efficient. Our ablation study further shows that scaling up the number of trajectory candidates consistently enhances overall performance. | [🔗 Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17450v1) |

| [Exploring fixed points and eigenstates of quantum systems with reinforcement learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17491v1) | María Laura Olivera-Atencio, Jesús Casado-Pascual, Denis Lacroix | 2025-11-21 | RLHF | We introduce a reinforcement learning algorithm designed to identify the fixed points of a given quantum operation. The method iteratively constructs the unitary transformation that maps the computational basis onto the basis of fixed points through a reward-penalty scheme based on quantum measurements. In cases where the operation corresponds to a Hamiltonian evolution, this task reduces to determining the Hamiltonian eigenstates. The algorithm is first benchmarked on random Hamiltonians acting on two and three qubits and then applied to many-body systems of up to six qubits, including the transverse-field Ising model and the all-to-all pairing Hamiltonian. In both cases, the algorithm is demonstrated to perform successfully; in the pairing model, it can also reveal hidden symmetries, which can be exploited to restrict learning to specific symmetry sectors. Finally, we discuss the possibility of post-selecting high-fidelity states even when full convergence has not been reached. | [🔗 Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17491v1) |

| [Enhancing Quranic Learning: A Multimodal Deep Learning Approach for Arabic Phoneme Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17477v1) | Ayhan Kucukmanisa, Derya Gelmez, Sukru Selim Calik, Zeynep Hilal Kilimci | 2025-11-21 | Multimodal AI, LLM, Model Evaluation, Responsible AI, Training & Evaluation | Recent advances in multimodal deep learning have greatly enhanced the capability of systems for speech analysis and pronunciation assessment. Accurate pronunciation detection remains a key challenge in Arabic, particularly in the context of Quranic recitation, where subtle phonetic differences can alter meaning. Addressing this challenge, the present study proposes a transformer-based multimodal framework for Arabic phoneme mispronunciation detection that combines acoustic and textual representations to achieve higher precision and robustness. The framework integrates UniSpeech-derived acoustic embeddings with BERT-based textual embeddings extracted from Whisper transcriptions, creating a unified representation that captures both phonetic detail and linguistic context. To determine the most effective integration strategy, early, intermediate, and late fusion methods were implemented and evaluated on two datasets containing 29 Arabic phonemes, including eight hafiz sounds, articulated by 11 native speakers. Additional speech samples collected from publicly available YouTube recordings were incorporated to enhance data diversity and generalization. Model performance was assessed using standard evaluation metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, allowing a detailed comparison of the fusion strategies. Experimental findings show that the UniSpeech-BERT multimodal configuration provides strong results and that fusion-based transformer architectures are effective for phoneme-level mispronunciation detection. The study contributes to the development of intelligent, speaker-independent, and multimodal Computer-Aided Language Learning (CALL) systems, offering a practical step toward technology-supported Quranic pronunciation training and broader speech-based educational applications. | [🔗 Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17477v1) |
| [Improving Multimodal Distillation for 3D Semantic Segmentation under Domain Shift](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17455v1) | Björn Michele, Alexandre Boulch, Gilles Puy, Tuan-Hung Vu, Renaud Marlet, Nicolas Courty | 2025-11-21 | Multimodal AI, Optimization | Semantic segmentation networks trained under full supervision for one type of lidar fail to generalize to unseen lidars without intervention. To reduce the performance gap under domain shifts, a recent trend is to leverage vision foundation models (VFMs) providing robust features across domains. In this work, we conduct an exhaustive study to identify recipes for exploiting VFMs in unsupervised domain adaptation for semantic segmentation of lidar point clouds. Building upon unsupervised image-to-lidar knowledge distillation, our study reveals that: (1) the architecture of the lidar backbone is key to maximize the generalization performance on a target domain; (2) it is possible to pretrain a single backbone once and for all, and use it to address many domain shifts; (3) best results are obtained by keeping the pretrained backbone frozen and training an MLP head for semantic segmentation. The resulting pipeline achieves state-of-the-art results in four widely-recognized and challenging settings.

| [Native 3D Editing with Full Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17501v1) | Weiwei Cai, Shuangkang Fang, Weicai Ye, Xin Dong, Yunhan Yang, Xuanyang Zhang, Wei Cheng, Yanpei Cao, Gang Yu, Tao Chen | 2025-11-21 | Optimization | Instruction-guided 3D editing is a rapidly emerging field with the potential to broaden access to 3D content creation. However, existing methods face critical limitations: optimization-based approaches are prohibitively slow, while feed-forward approaches relying on multi-view 2D editing often suffer from inconsistent geometry and degraded visual quality. To address these issues, we propose a novel native 3D editing framework that directly manipulates 3D representations in a single, efficient feed-forward pass. Specifically, we create a large-scale, multi-modal dataset for instruction-guided 3D editing, covering diverse addition, deletion, and modification tasks. This dataset is meticulously curated to ensure that edited objects faithfully adhere to the instructional changes while preserving the consistency of unedited regions with the source object. Building upon this dataset, we explore two distinct conditioning strategies for our model: a conventional cross-attention mechanism and a novel 3D token concatenation approach. Our results demonstrate that token concatenation is more parameter-efficient and achieves superior performance. Extensive evaluations show that our method outperforms existing 2D-lifting approaches, setting a new benchmark in generation quality, 3D consistency, and instruction fidelity. | [🔗 Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17501v1) |

| [Downscaling Intelligence: Exploring Perception and Reasoning Bottlenecks in Small Multimodal Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17487v1) | Mark Endo, Serena Yeung-Levy | 2025-11-21 | Scaling Laws, LLM, Multimodal AI | Scaling up multimodal models has enabled remarkable advances in visual understanding and reasoning, but practical demands call for smaller, efficient systems. In this work, we conduct a principled analysis of downscaling intelligence in multimodal models, examining how reduced large language model (LLM) capacity affects multimodal capabilities. Our initial findings reveal an interesting trend: LLM downscaling disproportionately affects visual capabilities, rather than abilities inherited from the LLM. We then examine whether this drop mainly reflects the expected decline in visual reasoning or a more fundamental loss of perceptual abilities. Isolating the effect of LLM downscaling on perception, we find performance still drops sharply, often matching or exceeding the impact on reasoning. To address this bottleneck, we introduce visual extraction tuning, which explicitly trains the model to extract instruction-relevant visual details consistently across tasks. With these extracted visual details, we then apply step-by-step reasoning to generate answers. Together, these components form our Extract+Think approach, setting a new standard for efficiency and performance in this space. | [🔗 Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17487v1) |
| [Thermalization of exact quantum many-body scars in spin-1 XY chain under perturbations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17476v1) | Himadri Halder | 2025-11-21 | Scaling Laws | Quantum many-body scars are special eigenstates that violate the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis while residing at finite energy density along with thermalizing eigenstates. The spin-1 XY model is known to host a family of such exceptional states originating from long-lived quasiparticle excitations that exhibit anomalously low entanglement entropy and long-time periodic revivals, resulting in weak ergodicity breaking. We study the stability of these scarred states against typical U(1) symmetry preserving perturbations in the XY chain. While perturbation theory can describe the deformed scar states at small system sizes, finite-size scaling of the perturbation matrix elements indicates that the scars ultimately thermalize in larger chains. Nonetheless, we demonstrate that the long-range order associated with the scars decays under the perturbation, and we estimate the relaxation timescale of oscillatory dynamics in certain local observables to be of order $λ^{-2}$, where $λ$ is the perturbation strength. | [🔗 Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17476v1) |
| [Masked-and-Reordered Self-Supervision for Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17473v1) | Zhen Wang, Zhifeng Gao, Guolin Ke | 2025-11-21 | Scaling Laws, LLM, Optimization, RLHF | Test-time scaling has been shown to substantially improve large language models' (LLMs) mathematical reasoning. However, for a large portion of mathematical corpora, especially theorem proving, RLVR's scalability is limited: intermediate reasoning is crucial, while final answers are difficult to directly and reliably verify. Meanwhile, token-level SFT often degenerates into rote memorization rather than inducing longer chains of thought. Inspired by BERT's self-supervised tasks, we propose MR-RLVR (Masked-and-Reordered RLVR), which constructs process-level self-supervised rewards via "masked-then-fill" and "step reordering" to extract learnable signals from intermediate reasoning. Our training pipeline comprises two stages: we first perform self-supervised training on sampled mathematical calculation and proof data; we then conduct RLVR fine-tuning on mathematical calculation datasets where only outcomes are verifiable. We implement MR-RLVR on Qwen2.5-3B and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, and evaluate on AIME24, AIME25, AMC23, and MATH500. Under a fixed sampling and decoding budget, MR-RLVR achieves average relative gains over the original RLVR of +9.86% Pass@1, +5.27% Pass@5, and +4.00% Pass@8. These results indicate that incorporating process-aware self-supervised signals can effectively enhance RLVR's scalability and performance in only outcome-verifiable settings. | [🔗 Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17473v1) |

Taylor, Pratik Chaudhari, Vijay Kumar | 2025-11-21 | Training & Evaluation | We demonstrate real-time high-altitude aerial metric-semantic mapping and exploration using a monocular camera paired with a global positioning system (GPS) and an inertial measurement unit (IMU). Our system, named HALO, addresses two key challenges: (i) real-time dense 3D reconstruction using vision at large distances, and (ii) mapping and exploration of large-scale outdoor environments with accurate scene geometry and semantics. We demonstrate that HALO can plan informative paths that exploit this information to complete missions with multiple tasks specified in natural language. In simulation-based evaluation across large-scale environments of size up to 78,000 sq. m., HALO consistently completes tasks with less exploration time and achieves up to 68% higher competitive ratio in terms of the distance traveled compared to the state-of-the-art semantic exploration baseline. We use real-world experiments on a custom quadrotor platform to demonstrate that (i) all modules can run onboard the robot, and that (ii) in diverse environments HALO can support effective autonomous execution of missions covering up to 24,600 sq. m. area at an altitude of 40 m.

| [Addressing A Posteriori Performance Degradation in Neural Network Subgrid Stress Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17475v1) | Andy Wu, Sanjiva K. Lele | 2025-11-21 | Training & Evaluation | Neural network subgrid stress models often have a priori performance that is far better than the a posteriori performance, leading to neural network models that look very promising a priori completely failing in a posteriori Large Eddy Simulations (LES). This performance gap can be decreased by combining two different methods, training data augmentation and reducing input complexity to the neural network. Augmenting the training data with two different filters before training the neural networks has no performance degradation a priori as compared to a neural network trained with one filter. A posteriori, neural networks trained with two different filters are far more robust across two different LES codes with different numerical schemes. In addition, by ablating away the higher order terms input into the neural network, the a priori versus a posteriori performance changes become less apparent. When combined, neural networks that use both training data augmentation and a less complex set of inputs have a posteriori performance far more reflective of their a priori evaluation. | [🔗 Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17475v1) |

The final detector configurations at the proposed FCC-ee are yet to be determined and this study aims to contribute to this discussion by benchmarking the particle identification (PID) performance of the proposed CLD and IDEA detectors using fully simulated events. At present, neither detector proposal includes dedicated PID systems, relying instead on information from the tracking subsystems. We estimate the expected level of contamination due to misidentified charged hadrons for $b$-flavour tagging, rare $b\to s$ transitions, and $s$-jet tagging. The PID information provided by silicon trackers, namely time-of-flight and energy-deposit measurements, leads to significant background suppression with high signal efficiency for the low-momentum hadrons considered for same-side $b$-flavour tagging. In order to improve the contamination in rare decays where momenta are in the medium range, only good timing resolution of 30ps and below can yield an improvement of one order of magnitude below the level achieved by kinematic criteria alone. Light-quark jet-flavour tagging requires identification of particles with very large momentum, which is not possible using only time-of-flight or energy-deposit information in silicon. Access to the number of clusters in a drift-chamber setup, as proposed for the IDEA detector however, results in strong background suppression in every case. This suppression can be further improved in some scenarios by time-of-flight resolution of 30-50ps or better. The PID quality generally exhibits only a small dependence on the cluster-counting efficiency. Whether dedicated PID detectors could further enhance flavour-physics sensitivity should be the subject of future study. | [🔗 Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17447v1) |

Yet most video QA models rely on single-pass perception over fixed frames, leading to hallucinations and failures on fine-grained evidence. Inspired by how humans pause, zoom, and re-read critical regions, we introduce Video-R4 (Reinforcing Text-Rich Video Reasoning with Visual Rumination), a video reasoning LMM that performs visual rumination: iteratively selecting frames, zooming into informative regions, re-encoding retrieved pixels, and updating its reasoning state. We construct two datasets with executable rumination trajectories: Video-R4-CoT-17k for supervised practice and Video-R4-RL-30k for reinforcement learning. We propose a multi-stage rumination learning framework that progressively finetunes a 7B LMM to learn atomic and mixing visual operations via SFT and GRPO-based RL. Video-R4-7B achieves state-of-the-art results on M4-ViteVQA and further generalizes to multi-page document QA, slides QA, and generic video QA, demonstrating that iterative rumination is an effective paradigm for pixel-grounded multimodal reasoning. | [🔗 Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17490v1) |
| [Scaling Conditional Autoencoders for Portfolio Optimization via Uncertainty-Aware Factor Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17462v1) | Ryan Engel, Yu Chen, Pawel Polak, Ioana Boier | 2025-11-21 | Prompt Engineering, Scaling Laws, Optimization | Conditional Autoencoders (CAEs) offer a flexible, interpretable approach for estimating latent asset-pricing factors from firm characteristics. However, existing studies usually limit the latent factor dimension to around K=5 due to concerns that larger K can degrade performance. To overcome this challenge, we propose a scalable framework that couples a high-dimensional CAE with an uncertainty-aware factor selection procedure. We employ three models for quantile prediction: zero-shot Chronos, a pretrained time-series foundation model (ZS-Chronos), gradient-boosted quantile regression trees using XGBoost and RAPIDS (Q-Boost), and an I.I.D bootstrap-based sample mean model (IID-BS). For each model, we rank factors by forecast uncertainty and retain the top-k most predictable factors for portfolio construction, where k denotes the selected subset of factors. This pruning strategy delivers substantial gains in risk-adjusted performance across all forecasting models. Furthermore, due to each model's uncorrelated predictions, a performance-weighted ensemble consistently outperforms individual models with higher Sharpe, Sortino, and Omega ratios. | [🔗 Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17462v1) |

While adversarial knowledge distillation has shown promise in transferring robustness from teacher to student models, traditional single-teacher approaches suffer from limited knowledge diversity, slow convergence, and difficulty in balancing robustness and accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose MMT-ARD: a Multimodal Multi-Teacher Adversarial Robust Distillation framework. Our key innovation is a dual-teacher knowledge fusion architecture that collaboratively optimizes clean feature preservation and robust feature enhancement. To better handle challenging adversarial examples, we introduce a dynamic weight allocation strategy based on teacher confidence, enabling adaptive focus on harder samples. Moreover, to mitigate bias among teachers, we design an adaptive sigmoid-based weighting function that balances the strength of knowledge transfer across modalities. Extensive experiments on ImageNet and zero-shot benchmarks demonstrate that MMT-ARD improves robust accuracy by +4.32% and zero-shot accuracy by +3.5% on the ViT-B-32 model, while achieving a 2.3x increase in training efficiency over traditional single-teacher methods. These results highlight the effectiveness and scalability of MMT-ARD in enhancing the adversarial robustness of multimodal large models.

In our approach, the agent embodies the user's "persona" (e.g. user profile or taste) and is powered by a large language model (LLM). To enable the agent to leverage rich contextual information, we introduce a Knowledge-Graph-enhanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Graph RAG) mechanism that constructs an LLM-derived graph index of relevant documents and summarizes communities of related information. Our framework generates personalized prompts by combining: (1) a summary of the user's historical behaviors and preferences extracted from the knowledge graph, and (2) relevant global interaction patterns identified through graph-based community detection. This dynamic prompt engineering approach allows the agent to maintain consistent persona-aligned behaviors while benefiting from collective knowledge. On the LaMP benchmark, our method improves news categorization F1 by 11.1%, movie tagging F1 by 56.1%, and reduces product rating MAE by 10.4% over prior methods.

| [Harnessing Data from Clustered LQR Systems: Personalized and Collaborative Policy Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17489v1) | Vinay Kanakeri, Shivam Bajaj, Ashwin Verma, Vijay Gupta, Aritra Mitra | 2025-11-21 | Responsible AI, RLHF, Optimization, Model Evaluation | It is known that reinforcement learning (RL) is data-hungry. To improve sample-efficiency of RL, it has been proposed that the learning algorithm utilize data from 'approximately similar' processes. However, since the process models are unknown, identifying which other processes are similar poses a challenge. In this work, we study this problem in the context of the benchmark Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) setting. Specifically, we consider a setting with multiple agents, each corresponding to a copy of a linear process to be controlled. The agents' local processes can be partitioned into clusters based on similarities in dynamics and tasks. Combining ideas from sequential elimination and zeroth-order policy optimization, we propose a new algorithm that performs simultaneous clustering and learning to output a personalized policy (controller) for each cluster. Under a suitable notion of cluster separation that captures differences in closed-loop performance across systems, we prove that our approach guarantees correct clustering with high probability. Furthermore, we show that the sub-optimality gap of the policy learned for each cluster scales inversely with the size of the cluster, with no additional bias, unlike in prior works on collaborative learning-based control. Our work is the first to reveal how clustering can be used in data-driven control to learn personalized policies that enjoy statistical gains from collaboration but do not suffer sub-optimality due to inclusion of data from dissimilar processes. From a distributed implementation perspective, our method is attractive as it incurs only a mild logarithmic communication overhead. | [🔗 Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17489v1) |
| [Structure-Function Coherent Coarsening for Cross-Resolution Ecohydrological Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17482v1) | Long Jiang, Yang Yang, Morgan Thornwell, Tiantian Yang, Hoshin Vijai Gupta | 2025-11-21 | Responsible AI, Model Evaluation | Ecohydrological models are increasingly applied across multiple scenarios, yet their application remains constrained by high computational costs of fine-resolution simulations and structural inconsistencies in cross-scale modeling. This study develops a Structure-Function Coherent Coarsening (SFCC) framework that preserves both hydrological connectivity and functional heterogeneity during model input coarsening. We apply the VELMA model to 24 subbasins in the Salish Sea Basin, U.S. and examine three types of inputs: (i) DEM coarsened with a Hydro-aware approach that preserves drainage topology; (ii) land-use and soil-type datasets coarsened with function-preserving methods (Auto-weight and Auto-reassign) that retain small but process-dominant classes; and (iii) initial conditions coarsened with hydrology-, land-cover-, and soil-aware strategies to enhance temporal stability. Results show that the Hydro-aware method effectively preserves watershed morphology and yields more consistent runoff and nitrate predictions than mean-based coarsening across scales. For categorical inputs, the function-preserving methods alleviate the dominant-class bias of majority aggregation, particularly in basins where small high-impact patches drive nitrogen export. Long-term simulations further show that although hydrological variables equilibrate rapidly and biogeochemical processes adjust more gradually, deviations in both decrease over time and converge toward a steady state. These demonstrate that structural consistency and functional preservation together maintain dynamic stability through spatiotemporal feedback. Compared with existing work, the proposed SFCC framework operates directly at the data-input level, enabling more coherent integration of multi-source datasets and maximizing the retention of high-resolution information. | [🔗 Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17482v1) |

Latiful Hoque | 2025-11-21 | Security & Adversarial ML, Production and Deployment | We present a patient-centric architecture for electronic health record (EHR) sharing that separates content storage from authorization and audit. Encrypted FHIR resources are stored off-chain; a public blockchain records only cryptographic commitments and patient-signed, time-bounded permissions using EIP-712. Keys are distributed via public-key wrapping, enabling storage providers to remain honest-but-curious without risking confidentiality. We formalize security goals (confidentiality, integrity, cryptographically attributable authorization, and auditability of authorization events) and provide a Solidity reference implementation deployed as single-patient contracts. On-chain costs for permission grants average 78,000 gas (L1), and end-to-end access latency for 1 MB records is 0.7--1.4s (mean values for S3 and IPFS respectively), dominated by storage retrieval. Layer-2 deployment reduces gas usage by 10--13x, though data availability charges dominate actual costs. We discuss metadata privacy, key registry requirements, and regulatory considerations (HIPAA/GDPR), demonstrating a practical route to restoring patient control while preserving security properties required for sensitive clinical data. | [🔗 Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17464v1) |

| [Stabilization and control of the nonlinear plate equation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17468v1) | Cristóbal Loyola | 2025-11-21 | LLM Ops | In this article we prove semiglobal stabilization and exact controllability results for nonlinear plate equations with hinged boundary conditions and analytic nonlinearity. These results hold when the damping or control is localized in a region where observability for the linear Schrödinger equation is known to hold. At the core of these results lies a new unique continuation property for the nonlinear plate equation, which significantly relaxes the geometric conditions required for such property to hold. This property is obtained by combining recent results on propagation of analyticity in time and unique continuation for linear plate operators. More broadly, our approach exploits the linear observability of the plate equation to establish both stabilization and control results. First, we prove exponential decay of the nonlinear energy under a defocusing assumption on the nonlinearity. Second, under a weaker asymptotic assumption on the nonlinearity, we prove semiglobal exact control by analyzing control properties inside the compact attractor provided by the dynamics of the damped equation. | [🔗 Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17468v1) |

We introduce a new method to study the generalized Lotka-Volterra model with stochastic dynamics on sparse graphs. By deriving local Fokker-Planck equations and employing a mean-field closure, we can efficiently compute stationary states for both symmetric and asymmetric interactions. We validate our approach by comparing the results with the direct integration of the dynamical equations and by reproducing known results and, for the first time, we map the phase diagram for sparse asymmetric networks. Our framework provides a versatile tool for exploring stability in realistic ecological communities and can be generalized to applications in different contexts, such as economics and evolutionary game theory. | [🔗 Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17499v1) |

We explore the relationship between the Ly$α$ line profile and environmental density with spectroscopy from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) of LAEs selected with narrow-band photometry through the One-hundred-deg$^2$ DECam Imaging in Narrowbands (ODIN) survey. We use LAE surface density maps in the N419 (z $\sim$ 2.45) and N501 (z $\sim$ 3.12) narrow bands to probe the relationship between local environmental density and the Ly$α$ line profile. In both narrow bands, we stack the LAE spectra in bins of environmental density and inside and outside of protocluster regions. The N501 data shows $\sim$15% higher Ly$α$ line luminosity for galaxies in protoclusters, suggesting increased star formation in these regions. However, the line luminosity is not appreciably greater in protocluster galaxies in the N419 band, suggesting a potential redshift evolution of this effect. The shape of the line profile itself does not vary with environmental density, suggesting that line shape changes are caused by local effects independent of a galaxy's environment. These data indicate a potential relationship between LAE local environmental density, ionized gas distribution, and Ly$α$ line luminosity. | [🔗 Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17498v1) |

Adapting Uchida's construction of $\text{SO}^\circ(p,q)$ actions on $\text{S}^{p+q-1}$, we explicitly construct analytic actions of $\text{SO}^\circ(p,q)$ on $\text{S}^{p} \times \text{S}^{q-1}$ and $\text{S}^{p-1} \times \text{S}^{q}$, as well as actions on $\text{SO}^\circ(p,q) \times_P \text{S}^1$, where $P$ is a maximal parabolic subgroup of $\text{SO}^\circ(p,q)$. The main result demonstrates that any analytic $\text{SO}^\circ(p,q)$ action on a closed, connected $(p+q-1)$-dimensional manifold is covered by one of the constructed actions. | [🔗 Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17495v1) |

Stott, Alessandro Jagatti, Andrea Lapini, Doris Möncke, Mario Agio | 2025-11-21 | General AI | Efficient detection of ultrafast phenomena is central to modern optical sciences, driving advances in quantum science and technology, physical chemistry, and nanophotonics. When processes occur on sub-picosecond timescales, time-resolved methods such as transient absorption, up-conversion, and optical Kerr gating (OKG) can be utilized to probe these dynamics, though they are typically applied to ensembles rather than single emitters. The OKG technique offers high detection efficiency over a broad spectral range, making it particularly promising for ultrafast single-photon detection at high-repetition-rates. Here, we present an ultrafast scheme based on the third-order nonlinearity of bismuth borosilicate (BBS) glass, operating at a 1 GHz repetition rate with less than 1 nJ pulse energy under focusing, and achieving a time resolution down to 175 fs. BBS glass was selected for its high nonlinear coefficient, which enhances detection efficiency, sub-ps response time, and its compatibility with standard microscopy platforms. | [🔗 Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17493v1) |

Millar-Blanchaer, Mark Chun, Philip Hinz, Charles-Antoine Claveau | 2025-11-21 | General AI | We present performance simulations for a proposed visible-light, multi-conjugate adaptive optics system for the 10-meter W. M. Keck I telescope that aims to deliver near diffraction-limited angular resolution at optical wavelengths. Our proposed architecture, the Keck Optical Laser Guide Star Adaptive Optics System (KOLA), combines multiple laser guide stars (LGS) and deformable mirrors to enable wide-field correction across a 60 arcsecond field of view. Simulations were conducted using the open-source Multi-Threaded Adaptive Optics Simulator (MAOS), which we validated against on-sky data for the current Keck I adaptive optics system. We evaluated KOLA performance across a range of design parameters and report key point spread function metrics, including Strehl ratio, full width at half maximum, and encircled energy radius. Example science-driven requirements include resolving black hole spheres of influence, probing crowded stellar fields, and imaging protoplanetary disks. Trade studies on actuator count and laser guide star configuration help inform future design decisions. We present a nominal KOLA design (10 LGS, 3 tip-tilt natural guide stars (TTNGS), and 3600 actuators on the adaptive secondary mirror). Performance simulations show a 15 mas angular resolution with a Strehl ratio of 34% at 652 nm on-axis. More work is needed to explore alternative LGS/TTNGS asterisms, optimize conjugation heights for high-altitude deformable mirrors, and test performance under poorer seeing conditions. | [🔗 Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17488v1) |
| [The Atlas Model and SDEs with Boundary Interaction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17486v1) | Philipp Jettkant | 2025-11-21 | General AI | We study the mean-field limit of the Atlas model and its connection to SDEs with dependence on the distribution of hitting and local times. The Atlas model describes a system of Brownian particles on the real line, where only the lowest ranked particle receives a positive drift, proportional to the number of particles. We show that in the mean-field limit the particle system converges to a novel SDE with reflection at a moving boundary, whose motion is such that the average local time spent at the boundary grows at a constant rate. In general, the boundary is represented by a measure, so the reflection must be interpreted in a relaxed sense. However, for sufficiently regular initial particle profiles, we prove that the boundary is a continuous function. Our analysis relies on a reformulation of the problem via McKean--Vlasov SDEs with interaction through hitting and local times. | [🔗 Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17486v1) |

Carrino, Siavash Khallaghi, Sam Hashemi | 2025-11-21 | General AI | The human spine is a complex structure composed of 33 vertebrae. It holds the body and is important for leading a healthy life. The spine is vulnerable to age-related degenerations that can be identified through magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In this paper we propose a novel computer-vison-based deep learning method to estimate spine age using images from over 18,000 MRI series. Data are restricted to subjects with only age-related spine degeneration. Eligibility criteria are created by identifying common age-based clusters of degenerative spine conditions using uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) and hierarchical density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (HDBSCAN). Model selection is determined using a detailed ablation study on data size, loss, and the effect of different spine regions. We evaluate the clinical utility of our model by calculating the difference between actual spine age and model-predicted age, the spine age gap (SAG), and examining the association between these differences and spine degenerative conditions and lifestyle factors. We find that SAG is associated with conditions including disc bulges, disc osteophytes, spinal stenosis, and fractures, as well as lifestyle factors like smoking and physically demanding work, and thus may be a useful biomarker for measuring overall spine health. | [🔗 Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17485v1) |
| [Efficient prediction of topological superlattice bands with spin-orbit coupling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17483v1) | M. Nabil Y. Lhachemi, Valentin Crépel, Jennifer Cano | 2025-11-21 | General AI | We develop a symmetry indicator framework to efficiently predict the topology of superlattice-induced minibands with spin-orbit coupling. Our algorithm requires input only from the parent material before the superlattice is applied. The simplification arises by assuming a perturbatively weak superlattice potential; however, our results extend beyond the perturbative regime as long as the superlattice-induced gaps remain open. We first consider a time-reversal- and inversion-symmetric system subject to a weak superlattice potential and derive a compact formula for the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariant of the lowest miniband. We then extend to time-reversal breaking systems and compute the Chern number. We apply our theory to selected transition metal dichalcogenides, HgTe/CdTe quantum wells, and thin films of three-dimensional topological insulators and Dirac semimetals. We find topological superlattice bands can arise even from non-topological materials, broadening the pool of candidates for realizing topological flat bands. Our theory predicts which geometry and periodicity of superlattice will yield topological bands for a given material, providing a clear guiding principle for designing topological superlattice heterostructures. | [🔗 Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17483v1) |

Patra, S. Shibash, Q. -P. Ding, Y. Furukawa, R. Nath | 2025-11-21 | General AI | A detailed study of the structural and magnetic properties of a spin-$5/2$ triangular lattice antiferromagnet RbFe(HPO$_{3}$)$_{2}$ is presented using x-ray diffraction, magnetization, heat capacity, and $^{31}$P nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments on a polycrystalline sample. The crystal structure features an equilateral triangular lattice of Fe$^{3+}$ ions. The thermodynamic measurements reveal the onset of a magnetic long-range order at $T_{\rm N1} \simeq 7.8$ K in zero-field, followed by another low temperature field induced ordering at $T_{\rm N2}$ in higher fields. The transition at $T_{\rm N1}$ is further confirmed from the NMR spin lattice relaxation measurements. The value of the frustration ratio ($f \simeq 7$) implies moderate spin frustration in the compound. The $^{31}$P NMR spectra exhibit two distinct spectral lines corresponding to two inequivalent phosphorus sites (P1 and P2), consistent with the crystal structure. The P1 site is strongly coupled with an isotropic hyperfine coupling of $A_{\rm hf}^{\rm iso} = 0.55(2)$ T/$μ_{\rm B}$ while the P2 site is weakly coupled with $A_{\rm hf}^{\rm iso} = 0.25(3)$ T/$μ_{\rm B}$ with the Fe$^{3+}$ ions. The magnetic susceptibility and NMR shift data are described well assuming a spin-$5/2$ isotropic triangular lattice antiferromagnetic model with an average exchange coupling of $J/k_{\rm B} = 2.8(2)$ K. Below $T_{\rm N1}$, the spectra evolve into a nearly rectangular powder pattern, indicating a commensurate antiferromagnetic type order. The $^{31}$P spin-lattice relaxation rate well below $T_{\rm N1}$ follows a $T^3$ temperature dependence, implying a two-magnon Raman scattering mechanism in the ordered state. Three well-defined phase regimes are clearly ascertained in the $H-T$ phase diagram, reflecting a weak magnetic anisotropy in the compound. | [🔗 Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17480v1) |

We present a novel methodology to investigate ultra-high frequency financial data and to evaluate the extent to which tick by tick returns resemble random sequences. We extend the analysis of ultra high-frequency stock market data by applying comprehensive sets of randomness tests, beyond the usual reliance on serial correlation or entropy measures. Our purpose is to extensively analyze the randomness of these data using statistical tests from standard batteries that evaluate different aspects of randomness.   We illustrate the effect of time aggregation in transforming highly correlated high-frequency trade data to random streams. More specifically, we use many of the tests in the NIST Statistical Test Suite and in the TestU01 battery (in particular the Rabbit and Alphabit sub-batteries), to prove that the degree of randomness of financial tick data increases together with the increase of the aggregation level in transaction time. Additionally, the comprehensive nature of our tests also uncovers novel patterns, such as non-monotonic behaviors in predictability for certain assets. This study demonstrates a model-free approach for both assessing randomness in financial time series and generating pseudo-random sequences from them, with potential relevance in several applications. | [🔗 Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17479v1) |

Using optical profilometry with curvature fitting, we extract the stress gradient (sigma1) and generate orientation-resolved stress maps across multiple film thicknesses (100 nm, 220 nm, and 460 nm). For films in the 220 to 460 nm range, we identify stress-free in-plane orientations near approximately 55 degrees and 125 degrees, enabling extremely flat suspended beams. In contrast, ultra-thin 100 nm films exhibit shifted stress-free orientations near approximately 20 degrees and 160 degrees. Leveraging these orientations, we demonstrate very long suspended beams up to 2 cm in length, 10 micrometers in width, and 460 nm in thickness without collapse. These results establish in-plane stress anisotropy and thickness selection in TFLN as practical design levers for mechanically stable, scalable, and stress-managed microelectromechanical systems (MEMS). | [🔗 Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17474v1) |
| [Moving superfluids in the rotating universe](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17472v1) | Jose Beltrán Jiménez, Federico Piazza, Javier Vecino | 2025-11-21 | General AI | We study homogeneous cosmological models featuring shift-symmetric scalar fields (or, superfluids) in relative motion. In the presence of anisotropy this universe generally features rotation, in the sense that the principal axes of anisotropic expansion rotate with respect to the cosmic comoving frame. We focus in particular on the minimal case of two superfluids in 2+1 dimensions. The momentum constraint enforces their spatial gradients to be collinear and the dynamics tends to align such a direction with that of maximal expansion at late times. As opposed to the recently studied case of solids, rotation plays a more important role in the present two-superfluids model. The associated energy density does not dilute away but scales as that of anisotropy and affects the total equation of state. We find that purely non-rotating solutions correspond to an unstable surface in phase space in the direction of non-vanishing rotation. This suggests that rotation is a crucial feature of these scenarios that cannot be neglected. | [🔗 Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17472v1) |

The detection relies on continuously monitoring the island's charge parity using microwave reflectometry. This scheme achieves 10% detection efficiency with sub 50 ns time resolution and short dead time 1 microsecond, for microwave photons at 10 GHz. The detector features three junctions connected to a superconducting island, which together carry out photoelectric conversion and charge readout. The enhanced light-matter coupling, crucial to photon to quasiparticle conversion, is provided by a granular aluminum-based high-impedance microwave resonator. The time resolved detection of itinerant microwave photon opens up new perspectives in quantum sensing, microwave quantum optics, readout of superconducting qubits and mesoscopic physics. | [🔗 Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17470v1) |

Grant, Susan C. van den Heever | 2025-11-21 | General AI | The individual and synergistic impacts of cold pools and land surface heterogeneity on convection initiation are investigated. Idealized large eddy simulations of deep convection over the Amazon rainforest are conducted. Simulations test realistic and homogenized vegetation, along with realistic and suppressed low-level evaporation which eliminates cold pools. Updrafts are tracked to determine convection initiation locations. The aggregation of initiation locations is quantified with an organization index. Initiation locations are randomly distributed over homogeneous vegetation, with or without cold pools, demonstrating that cold pools have minimal impacts on initiation locations over homogeneous vegetation. With realistic vegetation, convection initiation is more frequent over forested than deforested areas due to favorable thermodynamics. Heterogeneous vegetation effectively aggregates initiation locations and precipitation compared to homogeneous vegetation, whereas cold pools disaggregate initiation locations and precipitation by propagating into deforested regions and initiating convection. Thus, cold pools partially counteract the effects of anthropogenically driven land surface heterogeneity. | [🔗 Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17469v1) |

The interaction is short-ranged and controlled by a screening plane located a distance $d$ away. We consider the case where $d$ is less than the unit cell spacing $a$. We show that due to Pauli exclusion, a controlled expansion is possible despite the strong repulsion, and in many cases results in pairing. We demonstrate this for a tight-binding model on a triangular lattice with nearest neighbor repulsion. We also treat a second model on the triangular lattice with Wannier orbitals with size comparable to $a$. In this case we find $f$-wave pairing with order unity pairing strength, potentially leading to high $T_c$. | [🔗 Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17466v1) |
| [Extending the Accelerated Failure Conditionals Model to Location-Scale Families](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17463v1) | Jared N. Lakhani | 2025-11-21 | General AI | Arnold and Arvanitis (2020) introduced a novel class of bivariate conditionally specified distributions, in which dependence between two random variables is established by defining the distribution of one variable conditional on the other. This conditioning regime was formulated through survival functions and termed the accelerated failure conditionals model. Subsequently, Lakhani (2025) extended this conditioning framework to encompass distributional families whose marginal densities may exhibit unimodality and skewness, thereby moving beyond families with non-increasing densities. The present study builds on this line of work by proposing a conditional survival specification derived from a location-scale distributional family, where the dependence between $X$ and $Y$ arises not only through the acceleration function but also via a location function. An illustrative example of this new specification is developed using a Weibull marginal for $X$. The resulting models are fully characterized by closed-form expressions for their moments, and simulations are implemented using the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. Finally, the model is applied to a dataset in which the empirical distribution of $Y$ lies on the real line, demonstrating the models' capacity to accommodate $Y$ marginals defined over $\mathbb{R}$. | [🔗 Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17463v1) |
| [SRA-CP: Spontaneous Risk-Aware Selective Cooperative Perception](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17461v1) | Jiaxi Liu, Chengyuan Ma, Hang Zhou, Weizhe Tang, Shixiao Liang, Haoyang Ding, Xiaopeng Li, Bin Ran | 2025-11-21 | General AI | Cooperative perception (CP) offers significant potential to overcome the limitations of single-vehicle sensing by enabling information sharing among connected vehicles (CVs). However, existing generic CP approaches need to transmit large volumes of perception data that are irrelevant to the driving safety, exceeding available communication bandwidth. Moreover, most CP frameworks rely on pre-defined communication partners, making them unsuitable for dynamic traffic environments. This paper proposes a Spontaneous Risk-Aware Selective Cooperative Perception (SRA-CP) framework to address these challenges. SRA-CP introduces a decentralized protocol where connected agents continuously broadcast lightweight perception coverage summaries and initiate targeted cooperation only when risk-relevant blind zones are detected. A perceptual risk identification module enables each CV to locally assess the impact of occlusions on its driving task and determine whether cooperation is necessary. When CP is triggered, the ego vehicle selects appropriate peers based on shared perception coverage and engages in selective information exchange through a fusion module that prioritizes safety-critical content and adapts to bandwidth constraints. We evaluate SRA-CP on a public dataset against several representative baselines. Results show that SRA-CP achieves less than 1% average precision (AP) loss for safety-critical objects compared to generic CP, while using only 20% of the communication bandwidth. Moreover, it improves the perception performance by 15% over existing selective CP methods that do not incorporate risk awareness. | [🔗 Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17461v1) |

Adapted from double-drive reset of population (DDROP), the protocol utilizes simultaneous drives on the transmon and its readout resonator, leveraging the dispersive shift to create a directional process that returns the transmon to the computational subspace. The LRU achieves a 98.4% leakage removal fraction without compromising the computational-state assignment fidelity (99.2%). We combine LRU-enhanced measurement and neural-network decoding to successfully suppress logical error rates in both memory and stability QEC experiments without any post-selection. | [🔗 Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17460v1) |
| [Evolution of inhomogeneities in two-dimensional disordered superconductors in a magnetic field](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17459v1) | Poulami Sarkar, Jhinhwan Lee, Hae-Ryong Park, Anushree Dutta, Amit Ghosal | 2025-11-21 | General AI | Emerging granularity in superconducting films by tuning disorder is a well-studied topic, both theoretically and experimentally. However, the orbital magnetic field generates a vortex lattice and contributes to the formation of periodic inhomogeneities. Here, we study superconducting films in the simultaneous presence of disorder and a magnetic field, examining how inhomogeneities in various superconducting correlations evolve under these two perturbations. By performing scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) on thin films of \ce{Sr2VO_{3-\text{x}}FeAs} layer structures under both zero and finite orbital magnetic fields, we report impressive similarities between our theoretical results and the experimental findings. Our results have strong implications for identifying the nature of vortices in disordered superconductors, demonstrating a crossover from Abrikosov to Josephson character with increasing disorder, and provide predictive guidance for interpreting STS and current mapping data in complex superconductors. | [🔗 Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17459v1) |
| [Laminar and Turbulent Flow in Wavy Pipes under Strong Wall Modulations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17458v1) | Ismail El Mellas, Juan J. Hidalgo, Marco Dentz | 2025-11-21 | General AI | We investigate laminar and turbulent flow in pipes with periodically varying cross-sections, using direct numerical simulations over a range of Reynolds numbers between 1-5300. Pipe diameters are sinusoidally modulated in the axial direction, resulting in constrictions that reduce the local pipe radius by up to 40 percent. Such pronounced geometric roughness is encountered across disciplines, but is particularly relevant to karst systems, where dissolution-driven wall deformation leads to strong cross-sectional variability. Unlike classical roughness studies that assume small, homogeneous wall perturbations, the present configuration introduces large-scale axial variations that significantly affect flow structure, separation behaviour, and pressure drop even in the laminar regime. Once a critical roughness is exceeded, flow reversal appears at Reynolds numbers smaller than $25$, inducing local recirculation zones and significantly increasing friction. These effects are not captured by classical models based solely on bulk geometric parameters, but require the definition of an effective hydraulic radius. Furthermore, the strong wall-induced mixing promotes an early transitions to turbulence in a Reynolds range between 500 and 1000, well below the classical threshold for smooth pipes. At higher roughness, the influence of Reynolds number becomes increasingly hidden by geometric effects, as the flow is dominated by inertial separation and wall-induced disturbances. The peak-to-peak amplitude provides a robust estimator for the equivalent sandgrain roughness. These findings emphasise the limitations of traditional friction laws in geometrically complex conduits and point to the need for new models that account for the interplay between large-scale roughness and inertial effects. | [🔗 Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17458v1) |
| [GPR-OdomNet: Difference and Similarity-Driven Odometry Estimation Network for Ground Penetrating Radar-Based Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17457v1) | Huaichao Wang, Xuanxin Fan, Ji Liu, Haifeng Li, Dezhen Song | 2025-11-21 | General AI | When performing robot/vehicle localization using ground penetrating radar (GPR) to handle adverse weather and environmental conditions, existing techniques often struggle to accurately estimate distances when processing B-scan images with minor distinctions. This study introduces a new neural network-based odometry method that leverages the similarity and difference features of GPR B-scan images for precise estimation of the Euclidean distances traveled between the B-scan images. The new custom neural network extracts multi-scale features from B-scan images taken at consecutive moments and then determines the Euclidean distance traveled by analyzing the similarities and differences between these features. To evaluate our method, an ablation study and comparison experiments have been conducted using the publicly available CMU-GPR dataset. The experimental results show that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art counterparts in all tests. Specifically, our method achieves a root mean square error (RMSE), and achieves an overall weighted RMSE of 0.449 m across all data sets, which is a 10.2\% reduction in RMSE when compared to the best state-of-the-art method. | [🔗 Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17457v1) |
| [Fermat near misses and the integral Hilbert Property](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17456v1) | Jessica Alessandrì, Daniel Loughran | 2025-11-21 | General AI | We consider the Diophantine equation $x^4 + y^4 - w^2 = n$ for $n \in \mathbb{Z}$, which is related to near misses for the quartic case of Fermat's Last Theorem. For certain $n$ we show that the set of solutions is infinite, or more generally not thin. Our approach is via the geometry of del Pezzo surfaces of degree $2$, and we prove a more general result on non-thinness of integral points on double conic bundle surfaces. | [🔗 Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17456v1) |
| [Illustrator's Depth: Monocular Layer Index Prediction for Image Decomposition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17454v1) | Nissim Maruani, Peiying Zhang, Siddhartha Chaudhuri, Matthew Fisher, Nanxuan Zhao, Vladimir G. Kim, Pierre Alliez, Mathieu Desbrun, Wang Yifan | 2025-11-21 | General AI | We introduce Illustrator's Depth, a novel definition of depth that addresses a key challenge in digital content creation: decomposing flat images into editable, ordered layers. Inspired by an artist's compositional process, illustrator's depth infers a layer index to each pixel, forming an interpretable image decomposition through a discrete, globally consistent ordering of elements optimized for editability. We also propose and train a neural network using a curated dataset of layered vector graphics to predict layering directly from raster inputs. Our layer index inference unlocks a range of powerful downstream applications. In particular, it significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines for image vectorization while also enabling high-fidelity text-to-vector-graphics generation, automatic 3D relief generation from 2D images, and intuitive depth-aware editing. By reframing depth from a physical quantity to a creative abstraction, illustrator's depth prediction offers a new foundation for editable image decomposition. | [🔗 Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17454v1) |

Chulkov has proven that if the Taylor series of $f$ contains no monomials of degree $\leq 2$ then $μ(f) \geq p-1$ for any function germ $f$ invariant with respect to a nontrivial action of $\mathbb{Z}_p$ for prime $p$. Here we present a generalization of this inequality for actions of arbitrary abelian groups. | [🔗 Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17453v1) |
| [On gap properties for the linearized 1D Dirac--Soler model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17451v1) | Danko Aldunate, Julien Ricaud, Edgardo Stockmeyer | 2025-11-21 | General AI | We study spectral properties of the Dirac operator $L_0$ arising as the upper-right off-diagonal block in the linearization around standing wave solutions of the one-dimensional Soler model with power nonlinearity $f(s)=s s ^{p-1}$, $p>0$. Our main results concern the so-called gap property: we show that if $p \geq 1$, then the only eigenvalues of $L_0$ are its ground state energies, $-2ω$ and $0$. In contrast, for $p<1$, additional eigenvalues appear from the thresholds of the essential spectrum. Furthermore, we prove that the thresholds never admit eigenvalues and that they have at most one resonance. | [🔗 Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17451v1) |
| [Minimalist machine-learned interatomic potentials can predict complex structural behaviors accurately](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17449v1) | Iñigo Robredo-Magro, Binayak Mukherjee, Hugo Aramberri, Jorge Íñiguez-González | 2025-11-21 | General AI | The past decade has witnessed a spectacular development of machine-learned interatomic potentials (MLIPs), to the extent that they are already the approach of choice for most atomistic simulation studies not requiring an explicit treatment of electrons. Typical MLIP usage guidelines emphasize the need for exhaustive training sets and warn against applying the models to situations not considered in the corresponding training space. This restricts the scope of MLIPs to interpolative calculations, essentially denying the possibility of using them to discover new phenomena in a serendipitous way. While there are reasons to be cautious, here we adopt a more sanguine view and challenge the predictive power of two representative and widely available MLIP approaches. We work with minimalist training sets that rely on little prior knowledge of the investigated materials. We show that the resulting models -- for which we adopt modest/default choices of the defining hyperparameters -- are very successful in predicting non-trivial structural effects (competing polymorphs, energy barriers for structural transformations, occurrence of non-trivial topologies) in a way that is qualitatively and quasi-quantitatively correct. Our results thus suggest an expanded scope of modern MLIP approaches, evidencing that somewhat trivial -- and easy to compute -- models can be an effective tool for the discovery of novel and complex physical phenomena. | [🔗 Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17449v1) |
